Q: 
Goal of the bin_packing: Pack all the objects.

Available actions: 
pick: Pick an object that not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object. 
place: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object. 
bend: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action. 
push: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing. 
fold: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding. 

Constraints: 
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 


1. Describe the given images.
2. Create a plan that adheres to the given constraints and instructions.

---template start---
1. Description 
    - Describe the objects in the scene.
    - Identify the physical property of each object.
        [rigid, bendalbe, foldable, compressible, plastic(irreversibly deformable)]   
        1. 
        2.
        3.

2. Grounded Plan

A: 
---template start---

1. Description
   - Describe the objects in the scene.
     1. Red cube: Rigid
     2. Red dragon toy: Compressible
     3. White foam block: Compressible
     4. Brown cup: Plastic (irreversibly deformable)
     5. Black pipe cleaner: Bendable

2. Grounded Plan
   1. Pick the red dragon toy.
   2. Place the red dragon toy into the box.
   3. Push the red dragon toy.
   4. Pick the white foam block.
   5. Place the white foam block into the box.
   6. Push the white foam block.
   7. Pick the black pipe cleaner.
   8. Bend the black pipe cleaner.
   9. Place the black pipe cleaner into the box.
   10. Pick the red cube.
   11. Place the red cube into the box.
   12. Pick the brown cup.
   13. Place the brown cup into the box.
