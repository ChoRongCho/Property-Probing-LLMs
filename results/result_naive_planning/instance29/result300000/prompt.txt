Q: 
Goal of the bin_packing: Pack all the objects.

Available actions: 
pick: Pick an object that not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object. 
place: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object. 
bend: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action. 
push: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing. 
fold: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding. 

Constraints: 
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 


1. Describe the given images.
2. Create a plan that adheres to the given constraints and instructions.

A: 
---template start---

1. Description
   - Describe the objects in the scene.
     - A red plush dragon, a yellow sponge, a brown silicone cup, a clear plastic lid, and a yellow cloth.
   - Identify the physical property of each object.
     1. Red plush dragon: compressible
     2. Yellow sponge: compressible
     3. Brown silicone cup: rigid
     4. Clear plastic lid: plastic (irreversibly deformable)
     5. Yellow cloth: foldable

2. Grounded Plan
   1. Pick the yellow sponge.
   2. Place the yellow sponge into the box.
   3. Push the yellow sponge.
   4. Pick the red plush dragon.
   5. Place the red plush dragon into the box.
   6. Push the red plush dragon.
   7. Pick the yellow cloth.
   8. Fold the yellow cloth.
   9. Place the yellow cloth into the box.
   10. Pick the brown silicone cup.
   11. Place the brown silicone cup into the box.
   12. Pick the clear plastic lid.
   13. Place the clear plastic lid into the box.
