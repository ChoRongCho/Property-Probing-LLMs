Q: 
Goal of the bin_packing: Pack all the objects.

Available actions: 
pick: Pick an object that not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object. 
place: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object. 
bend: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action. 
push: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing. 
fold: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding. 

Constraints: 
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 


1. Describe the given images.
2. Create a plan that adheres to the given constraints and instructions.

---template start---
1. Description 
    - Describe the objects in the scene.
    - Identify the physical property of each object.
        [rigid, bendalbe, foldable, compressible, plastic(irreversibly deformable)]   
        1. 
        2.
        3.

2. Grounded Plan

A: 
---template start---

1. Description 
   - Describe the objects in the scene.
     - A plastic bottle, a foam block, a metal wire, a wooden stick, and a cylindrical container.
   - Identify the physical property of each object.
     1. Plastic bottle: plastic (irreversibly deformable)
     2. Foam block: compressible
     3. Metal wire: bendable
     4. Wooden stick: rigid
     5. Cylindrical container: rigid

2. Grounded Plan

   1. **Pick** the foam block.
   2. **Place** the foam block into the box.
   3. **Push** the foam block in the box.
   4. **Pick** the plastic bottle.
   5. **Place** the plastic bottle into the box.
   6. **Pick** the metal wire.
   7. **Bend** the metal wire.
   8. **Place** the metal wire into the box.
   9. **Pick** the wooden stick.
   10. **Place** the wooden stick into the box.
   11. **Pick** the cylindrical container.
   12. **Place** the cylindrical container into the box.
