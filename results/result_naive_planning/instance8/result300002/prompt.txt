Q: 
Goal of the bin_packing: Pack all the objects.

Available actions: 
pick: Pick an object that not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object. 
place: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object. 
bend: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action. 
push: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing. 
fold: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding. 

Constraints: 
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 


1. Describe the given images.
2. Create a plan that adheres to the given constraints and instructions.

1. Description 
    - Describe the objects in the scene.
    - Identify the physical property of each object.
        [rigid, bendalbe, foldable, compressible, plastic(irreversibly deformable)]

A: 
---template start---

1. Description 
   - Describe the objects in the scene:
     - A red cube, a brown cup, a blue bottle, a white bottle, a blue sheet, a yellow sheet, and a metal wire.
   - Identify the physical property of each object:
     1. Red cube: rigid
     2. Brown cup: compressible
     3. Blue bottle: plastic
     4. White bottle: plastic
     5. Blue sheet: foldable
     6. Yellow sheet: foldable
     7. Metal wire: bendable

2. Grounded Plan

   1. **pick** the brown cup
   2. **place** the brown cup in the box
   3. **push** the brown cup
   4. **pick** the metal wire
   5. **bend** the metal wire
   6. **place** the metal wire in the box
   7. **pick** the blue sheet
   8. **fold** the blue sheet
   9. **place** the blue sheet in the box
   10. **pick** the yellow sheet
   11. **fold** the yellow sheet
   12. **place** the yellow sheet in the box
   13. **pick** the red cube
   14. **place** the red cube in the box
   15. **pick** the blue bottle
   16. **place** the blue bottle in the box
   17. **pick** the white bottle
   18. **place** the white bottle in the box
