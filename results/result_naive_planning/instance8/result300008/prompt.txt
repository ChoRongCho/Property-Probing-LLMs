Q: 
Goal of the bin_packing: Pack all the objects.

Available actions: 
pick: Pick an object that not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object. 
place: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object. 
bend: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action. 
push: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing. 
fold: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding. 

Constraints: 
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 


1. Describe the given images.
2. Create a plan that adheres to the given constraints and instructions.

---template start---
1. Description 
    - Describe the objects in the scene.
    - Identify the physical property of each object.
        [rigid, bendalbe, foldable, compressible, plastic(irreversibly deformable)]   
        1. 
        2.
        3.

2. Grounded Plan

A: 
---template start---

1. Description 
   - Describe the objects in the scene.
     - A red cube, a blue bottle, a white bottle, a brown cup, a blue sheet, a yellow sheet, and a metal wire.
   - Identify the physical property of each object.
     1. Red cube: rigid
     2. Blue bottle: plastic (irreversibly deformable)
     3. White bottle: plastic (irreversibly deformable)
     4. Brown cup: compressible
     5. Blue sheet: foldable
     6. Yellow sheet: foldable
     7. Metal wire: bendable

2. Grounded Plan
   1. Pick the brown cup.
   2. Place the brown cup in the box.
   3. Push the brown cup.
   4. Pick the metal wire.
   5. Bend the metal wire.
   6. Pick the blue sheet.
   7. Fold the blue sheet.
   8. Pick the yellow sheet.
   9. Fold the yellow sheet.
   10. Pick the red cube.
   11. Place the red cube in the box.
   12. Pick the bent metal wire.
   13. Place the bent metal wire in the box.
   14. Pick the folded blue sheet.
   15. Place the folded blue sheet in the box.
   16. Pick the folded yellow sheet.
   17. Place the folded yellow sheet in the box.
   18. Pick the blue bottle.
   19. Place the blue bottle in the box.
   20. Pick the white bottle.
   21. Place the white bottle in the box.
