Q: 
Goal of the bin_packing: Pack all the objects.

Available actions: 
pick: Pick an object that not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object. 
place: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object. 
bend: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action. 
push: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing. 
fold: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding. 

Constraints: 
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 


1. Describe the given images.
2. Create a plan that adheres to the given constraints and instructions.

---template start---
1. Description 
    - Describe the objects in the scene.
    - Identify the physical property of each object.
        [rigid, bendalbe, foldable, compressible, plastic(irreversibly deformable)]   
        1. 
        2.
        3.

2. Grounded Plan

 
---template end---


A: 
---template start---

1. Description
   - The scene contains a variety of objects including a toy, bottles, a tube, a pipe cleaner, and a plastic lid.
   - Identify the physical property of each object.
     1. Toy dragon: compressible
     2. Green tube: rigid
     3. Blue bottle: plastic (irreversibly deformable)
     4. Clear bottle: plastic (irreversibly deformable)
     5. Pipe cleaner: bendable
     6. Plastic lid: plastic (irreversibly deformable)

2. Grounded Plan
   1. Pick the toy dragon.
   2. Place the toy dragon in the box.
   3. Push the toy dragon.
   4. Pick the pipe cleaner.
   5. Bend the pipe cleaner.
   6. Place the pipe cleaner in the box.
   7. Pick the green tube.
   8. Place the green tube in the box.
   9. Pick the blue bottle.
   10. Place the blue bottle in the box.
   11. Pick the clear bottle.
   12. Place the clear bottle in the box.
   13. Pick the plastic lid.
   14. Place the plastic lid in the box.
