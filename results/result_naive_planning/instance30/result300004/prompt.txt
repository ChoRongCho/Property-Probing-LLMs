Q: 
Goal of the bin_packing: Pack all the objects.

Available actions: 
pick: Pick an object that not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object. 
place: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object. 
bend: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action. 
push: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing. 
fold: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding. 

Constraints: 
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 


1. Describe the given images.
2. Create a plan that adheres to the given constraints and instructions.

---template start---
1. Description 
    - Describe the objects in the scene.
    - Identify the physical property of each object.
        [rigid, bendalbe, foldable, compressible, plastic(irreversibly deformable)]   
        1. 
        2.
        3.

2. Grounded Plan

A: 
---template start---

1. Description
   - The scene contains several objects: a plush dragon, a plastic bottle, a green cylindrical object, a blue cylindrical object, a plastic lid, and a bendable black object.
   - Identify the physical property of each object.
     1. Plush dragon: compressible
     2. Plastic bottle: plastic (irreversibly deformable)
     3. Green cylindrical object: rigid
     4. Blue cylindrical object: rigid
     5. Plastic lid: plastic (irreversibly deformable)
     6. Black object: bendable

2. Grounded Plan
   1. Pick the plush dragon.
   2. Place the plush dragon into the box.
   3. Push the plush dragon in the box.
   4. Pick the black bendable object.
   5. Bend the black object.
   6. Place the black object into the box.
   7. Pick the green cylindrical object.
   8. Place the green cylindrical object into the box.
   9. Pick the blue cylindrical object.
   10. Place the blue cylindrical object into the box.
   11. Pick the plastic bottle.
   12. Place the plastic bottle into the box.
   13. Pick the plastic lid.
   14. Place the plastic lid into the box.
