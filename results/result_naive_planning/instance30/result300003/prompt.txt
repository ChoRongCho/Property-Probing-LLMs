Q: 
Goal of the bin_packing: Pack all the objects.

Available actions: 
pick: Pick an object that not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object. 
place: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object. 
bend: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action. 
push: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing. 
fold: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding. 

Constraints: 
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 


1. Describe the given images.
2. Create a plan that adheres to the given constraints and instructions.

---template start---
1. Description 
    - Describe the objects in the scene.
    - Identify the physical property of each object.
        [rigid, bendalbe, foldable, compressible, plastic(irreversibly deformable)]   
        1. 
        2.
        3.

2. Grounded Plan

 
---template end---


A: 
---template start---

1. Description
   - The scene contains a variety of objects: a dragon toy, a plastic bottle, a sponge, a bendable wire, a plastic lid, and a cylindrical container.
   - Identify the physical property of each object.
     1. Dragon toy: compressible
     2. Plastic bottle: plastic (irreversibly deformable)
     3. Sponge: compressible
     4. Bendable wire: bendable
     5. Plastic lid: plastic (irreversibly deformable)
     6. Cylindrical container: rigid

2. Grounded Plan
   - Pick the sponge.
   - Place the sponge into the box.
   - Push the sponge.
   - Pick the dragon toy.
   - Place the dragon toy into the box.
   - Push the dragon toy.
   - Pick the bendable wire.
   - Bend the wire.
   - Place the wire into the box.
   - Pick the cylindrical container.
   - Place the cylindrical container into the box.
   - Pick the plastic bottle.
   - Place the plastic bottle into the box.
   - Pick the plastic lid.
   - Place the plastic lid into the box.
