Q: 
Goal of the bin_packing: Pack all the objects.

Available actions: 
pick: Pick an object that not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object. 
place: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object. 
bend: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action. 
push: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing. 
fold: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding. 

Constraints: 
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 


1. Describe the given images.
2. Create a plan that adheres to the given constraints and instructions.

---template start---
1. Description 
    - Describe the objects in the scene.
    - Identify the physical property of each object.
        [rigid, bendalbe, foldable, compressible, plastic(irreversibly deformable)]   
        1. 
        2.
        3.

2. Grounded Plan

A: 
---template start---

1. Description
   - The scene contains a variety of objects: a sponge, a foam block, a pipe cleaner, a plastic bottle, a silicone cup, and a piece of blue paper.
   - Identify the physical property of each object.
     1. Sponge: compressible
     2. Foam block: compressible
     3. Pipe cleaner: bendable
     4. Plastic bottle: plastic (irreversibly deformable)
     5. Silicone cup: compressible
     6. Blue paper: foldable

2. Grounded Plan
   1. **pick** the sponge
   2. **place** the sponge into the box
   3. **push** the sponge
   4. **pick** the foam block
   5. **place** the foam block into the box
   6. **push** the foam block
   7. **pick** the silicone cup
   8. **place** the silicone cup into the box
   9. **push** the silicone cup
   10. **pick** the pipe cleaner
   11. **bend** the pipe cleaner
   12. **place** the pipe cleaner into the box
   13. **pick** the blue paper
   14. **fold** the blue paper
   15. **place** the blue paper into the box
   16. **pick** the plastic bottle
   17. **place** the plastic bottle into the box
