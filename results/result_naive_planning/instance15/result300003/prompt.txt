Q: 
Goal of the bin_packing: Pack all the objects.

Available actions: 
pick: Pick an object that not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object. 
place: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object. 
bend: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action. 
push: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing. 
fold: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding. 

Constraints: 
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 


1. Describe the given images.
2. Create a plan that adheres to the given constraints and instructions.

---template start---
1. Description 
    - Describe the objects in the scene.
    - Identify the physical property of each object.
        [rigid, bendalbe, foldable, compressible, plastic(irreversibly deformable)]   
        1. 
        2.
        3.

2. Grounded Plan

A: 
---template start---

1. Description 
   - The scene contains the following objects:
     1. A sponge with a yellow band: compressible
     2. A white foam block: compressible
     3. A brown container: rigid
     4. A black pipe cleaner: bendable
     5. A plastic bottle: plastic (irreversibly deformable)
     6. A blue sheet: foldable

2. Grounded Plan

   1. **pick** the sponge
   2. **place** the sponge in the box
   3. **push** the sponge
   4. **pick** the foam block
   5. **place** the foam block in the box
   6. **push** the foam block
   7. **pick** the pipe cleaner
   8. **bend** the pipe cleaner
   9. **place** the pipe cleaner in the box
   10. **pick** the blue sheet
   11. **fold** the blue sheet
   12. **place** the blue sheet in the box
   13. **pick** the plastic bottle
   14. **place** the plastic bottle in the box
   15. **pick** the brown container
   16. **place** the brown container in the box
