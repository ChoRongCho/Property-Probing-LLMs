Q: 
Goal of the bin_packing: Pack all the objects.

Available actions: 
pick: Pick an object that not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object. 
place: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object. 
bend: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action. 
push: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing. 
fold: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding. 

Constraints: 
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 


1. Describe the given images.
2. Create a plan that adheres to the given constraints and instructions.

---template start---
1. Description 
    - Describe the objects in the scene.
    - Identify the physical property of each object.
        [rigid, bendalbe, foldable, compressible, plastic(irreversibly deformable)]   
        1.

A: 
---template start---

1. Description 
   - The scene contains five objects: a sponge, a foam block, a silicone cup, a plastic bottle, and a piece of yellow fabric.
   - Identify the physical property of each object.
     1. Sponge: compressible
     2. Foam block: compressible
     3. Silicone cup: bendable
     4. Plastic bottle: plastic
     5. Yellow fabric: foldable

2. Grounded Plan
   1. Pick the silicone cup.
   2. Bend the silicone cup.
   3. Place the silicone cup in the box.
   4. Pick the yellow fabric.
   5. Fold the yellow fabric.
   6. Place the yellow fabric in the box.
   7. Pick the sponge.
   8. Place the sponge in the box.
   9. Push the sponge.
   10. Pick the foam block.
   11. Place the foam block in the box.
   12. Push the foam block.
   13. Pick the plastic bottle.
   14. Place the plastic bottle in the box.
