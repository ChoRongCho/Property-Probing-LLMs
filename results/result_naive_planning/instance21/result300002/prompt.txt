Q: 
Goal of the bin_packing: Pack all the objects.

Available actions: 
pick: Pick an object that not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object. 
place: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object. 
bend: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action. 
push: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing. 
fold: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding. 

Constraints: 
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 


1. Describe the given images.
2. Create a plan that adheres to the given constraints and instructions.

---template start---
1. Description 
    - Describe the objects in the scene.
    - Identify the physical property of each object.
        [rigid, bendalbe, foldable, compressible, plastic(irreversibly deformable)]   
        1. 
        2.
        3.

2. Grounded Plan

A: 
---template start---

1. Description
   - The scene contains five objects: a foam block, a brown cup, a blue sheet, a yellow sheet, and a clear plastic lid.
   - Identify the physical property of each object.
     1. Foam block: compressible
     2. Brown cup: rigid
     3. Blue sheet: foldable
     4. Yellow sheet: foldable
     5. Clear plastic lid: plastic (irreversibly deformable)

2. Grounded Plan
   1. Pick the foam block.
   2. Place the foam block into the box.
   3. Push the foam block.
   4. Pick the blue sheet.
   5. Fold the blue sheet.
   6. Place the blue sheet into the box.
   7. Pick the yellow sheet.
   8. Fold the yellow sheet.
   9. Place the yellow sheet into the box.
   10. Pick the brown cup.
   11. Place the brown cup into the box.
   12. Pick the clear plastic lid.
   13. Place the clear plastic lid into the box.
