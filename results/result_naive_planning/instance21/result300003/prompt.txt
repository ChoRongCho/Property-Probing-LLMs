Q: 
Goal of the bin_packing: Pack all the objects.

Available actions: 
pick: Pick an object that not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object. 
place: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object. 
bend: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action. 
push: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing. 
fold: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding. 

Constraints: 
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 


1. Describe the given images.
2. Create a plan that adheres to the given constraints and instructions.

---template start---
1. Description 
    - Describe the objects in the scene.
    - Identify the physical property of each object.
        [rigid, bendalbe, foldable, compressible, plastic(irreversibly deformable)]   
        1. 
        2.
        3.

2. Grounded Plan

A: 
---template start---
1. Description 
   - The scene contains five objects: a piece of foam, a brown cup, a blue sheet, a yellow sheet, and a transparent plastic lid.
   - Identify the physical property of each object.
     1. Foam: compressible
     2. Brown cup: rigid
     3. Blue sheet: foldable
     4. Yellow sheet: foldable
     5. Transparent plastic lid: plastic (irreversibly deformable)

2. Grounded Plan
   1. pick foam
   2. place foam in the box
   3. push foam
   4. pick blue sheet
   5. fold blue sheet
   6. place blue sheet in the box
   7. pick yellow sheet
   8. fold yellow sheet
   9. place yellow sheet in the box
   10. pick brown cup
   11. place brown cup in the box
   12. pick plastic lid
   13. place plastic lid in the box
---template end---
