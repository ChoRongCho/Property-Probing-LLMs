Q: 
Goal of the bin_packing: Pack all the objects.

Available actions: 
pick: Pick an object that not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object. 
place: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object. 
bend: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action. 
push: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing. 
fold: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding. 

Constraints: 
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 


1. Describe the given images.
2. Create a plan that adheres to the given constraints and instructions.

---template start---
1. Description 
    - Describe the objects in the scene.
    - Identify the physical property of each object.
        [rigid, bendalbe, foldable, compressible, plastic(irreversibly deformable)]   
        1. 
        2.
        3.

2. Grounded Plan

A: 
---template start---

1. Description
   - Describe the objects in the scene.
     - A red dragon toy
     - A brown cup
     - A black bendable stick
     - A silver bendable wire
     - A wooden stick
     - A round plastic lid

   - Identify the physical property of each object.
     1. Red dragon toy: compressible
     2. Brown cup: rigid
     3. Black bendable stick: bendable
     4. Silver bendable wire: bendable
     5. Wooden stick: rigid
     6. Round plastic lid: plastic

2. Grounded Plan
   1. pick the red dragon toy
   2. place the red dragon toy into the box
   3. push the red dragon toy
   4. pick the black bendable stick
   5. bend the black bendable stick
   6. place the black bendable stick into the box
   7. pick the silver bendable wire
   8. bend the silver bendable wire
   9. place the silver bendable wire into the box
   10. pick the brown cup
   11. place the brown cup into the box
   12. pick the wooden stick
   13. place the wooden stick into the box
   14. pick the round plastic lid
   15. place the round plastic lid into the box
