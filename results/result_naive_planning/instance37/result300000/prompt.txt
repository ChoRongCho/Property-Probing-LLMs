Q: 
Goal of the bin_packing: Pack all the objects.

Available actions: 
pick: Pick an object that not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object. 
place: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object. 
bend: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action. 
push: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing. 
fold: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding. 

Constraints: 
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 


1. Describe the given images.
2. Create a plan that adheres to the given constraints and instructions.

---template start---
1. Description 
    - Describe the objects in the scene.
    - Identify the physical property of each object.
        [rigid, bendalbe, foldable, compressible, plastic(irreversibly deformable)]   
        1. 
        2.
        3.

2. Grounded Plan

A: 
---template start---

1. Description
   - Describe the objects in the scene.
     - A red plush toy, a brown cup, a black bendable object, a silver bendable object, a wooden stick, and a transparent plastic lid.
   - Identify the physical property of each object.
     1. Red plush toy: compressible
     2. Brown cup: rigid
     3. Black object: bendable
     4. Silver object: bendable
     5. Wooden stick: rigid
     6. Transparent lid: plastic (irreversibly deformable)

2. Grounded Plan
   1. Pick the red plush toy.
   2. Place the red plush toy into the box.
   3. Push the red plush toy.
   4. Bend the black bendable object.
   5. Pick the black bendable object.
   6. Place the black bendable object into the box.
   7. Bend the silver bendable object.
   8. Pick the silver bendable object.
   9. Place the silver bendable object into the box.
   10. Pick the brown cup.
   11. Place the brown cup into the box.
   12. Pick the wooden stick.
   13. Place the wooden stick into the box.
   14. Pick the transparent lid.
   15. Place the transparent lid into the box.
