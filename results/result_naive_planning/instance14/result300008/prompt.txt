Q: 
Goal of the bin_packing: Pack all the objects.

Available actions: 
pick: Pick an object that not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object. 
place: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object. 
bend: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action. 
push: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing. 
fold: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding. 

Constraints: 
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 


1. Describe the given images.
2. Create a plan that adheres to the given constraints and instructions.

---template start---
1. Description 
    - Describe the objects in the scene.
    - Identify the physical property of each object.
        [rigid, bendalbe, foldable, compressible, plastic(irreversibly deformable)]

A: 
---template start---
1. Description 
    - Describe the objects in the scene.
        - A sponge with a yellow band.
        - A white foam block.
        - A blue plastic bottle.
        - A wooden stick.
        - A blue sheet of paper.
    - Identify the physical property of each object.
        1. Sponge: compressible
        2. Foam block: compressible
        3. Plastic bottle: plastic
        4. Wooden stick: bendable
        5. Blue paper: foldable

2. Grounded Plan
    1. pick sponge
    2. place sponge in the box
    3. push sponge
    4. pick foam block
    5. place foam block in the box
    6. push foam block
    7. pick plastic bottle
    8. place plastic bottle in the box
    9. pick wooden stick
    10. bend wooden stick
    11. place wooden stick in the box
    12. pick blue paper
    13. fold blue paper
    14. place blue paper in the box
