Q: 
Goal of the bin_packing: Pack all the objects.

Available actions: 
pick: Pick an object that not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object. 
place: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object. 
bend: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action. 
push: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing. 
fold: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding. 

Constraints: 
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 


1. Describe the given images.
2. Create a plan that adheres to the given constraints and instructions.

---template start---
1. Description 
    - Describe the objects in the scene.
    - Identify the physical property of each object.
        [rigid, bendalbe, foldable, compressible, plastic(irreversibly deformable)]   
        1. 
        2.
        3.

2. Grounded Plan

A: 
---template start---

1. Description
   - Describe the objects in the scene.
     - A red plush dragon, a piece of foam, a metal wire, and a green cylindrical object.
   - Identify the physical property of each object.
     1. Red plush dragon: compressible
     2. Foam: compressible
     3. Metal wire: bendable
     4. Green cylindrical object: rigid

2. Grounded Plan

   1. **pick** the metal wire
   2. **bend** the metal wire
   3. **pick** the foam
   4. **place** the foam into the box
   5. **push** the foam
   6. **pick** the red plush dragon
   7. **place** the red plush dragon into the box
   8. **push** the red plush dragon
   9. **pick** the green cylindrical object
   10. **place** the green cylindrical object into the box
   11. **pick** the bent metal wire
   12. **place** the bent metal wire into the box
