Q: 
Goal of the bin_packing: Pack all the objects.

Available actions: 
pick: Pick an object that not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object. 
place: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object. 
bend: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action. 
push: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing. 
fold: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding. 

Constraints: 
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 


1. Describe the given images.
2. Create a plan that adheres to the given constraints and instructions.

---template start---
1. Description 
    - Describe the objects in the scene.
    - Identify the physical property of each object.
        [rigid, bendalbe, foldable, compressible, plastic(irreversibly deformable)]   
        1.

A: 
---template start---

1. Description
   - The scene contains four objects: a red dragon toy, a piece of foam, a wire, and a green cylindrical object.
   - Identify the physical property of each object.
     1. Red dragon toy: compressible
     2. Foam: compressible
     3. Wire: bendable
     4. Green cylindrical object: rigid

2. Grounded Plan
   1. Pick the wire.
   2. Bend the wire.
   3. Pick the foam.
   4. Place the foam in the box.
   5. Push the foam.
   6. Pick the red dragon toy.
   7. Place the red dragon toy in the box.
   8. Push the red dragon toy.
   9. Pick the green cylindrical object.
   10. Place the green cylindrical object in the box.
   11. Pick the bent wire.
   12. Place the bent wire in the box.
