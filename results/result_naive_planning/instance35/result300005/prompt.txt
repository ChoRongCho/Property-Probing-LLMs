Q: 
Goal of the bin_packing: Pack all the objects.

Available actions: 
pick: Pick an object that not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object. 
place: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object. 
bend: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action. 
push: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing. 
fold: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding. 

Constraints: 
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 


1. Describe the given images.
2. Create a plan that adheres to the given constraints and instructions.

---template start---
1. Description 
    - Describe the objects in the scene.
    - Identify the physical property of each object.
        [rigid, bendalbe, foldable, compressible, plastic(irreversibly deformable)]

A: 
---template start---

1. Description
   - The scene contains six objects: a black pipe cleaner, a wooden stick, a green cylindrical object, a brown cup, a transparent lid, and a blue sheet.
   - Identify the physical property of each object.
     1. Black pipe cleaner: bendable
     2. Wooden stick: rigid
     3. Green cylindrical object: plastic (irreversibly deformable)
     4. Brown cup: compressible
     5. Transparent lid: plastic (irreversibly deformable)
     6. Blue sheet: foldable

2. Grounded Plan
   1. Pick the brown cup.
   2. Place the brown cup in the box.
   3. Push the brown cup.
   4. Pick the black pipe cleaner.
   5. Bend the black pipe cleaner.
   6. Place the black pipe cleaner in the box.
   7. Pick the blue sheet.
   8. Fold the blue sheet.
   9. Place the blue sheet in the box.
   10. Pick the green cylindrical object.
   11. Place the green cylindrical object in the box.
   12. Pick the transparent lid.
   13. Place the transparent lid in the box.
   14. Pick the wooden stick.
   15. Place the wooden stick in the box.
