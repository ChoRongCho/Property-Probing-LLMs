Q: 
Goal of the bin_packing: Pack all the objects.

Available actions: 
pick: Pick an object that not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object. 
place: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object. 
bend: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action. 
push: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing. 
fold: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding. 

Constraints: 
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 


1. Describe the given images.
2. Create a plan that adheres to the given constraints and instructions.

---template start---
1. Description 
    - Describe the objects in the scene.
    - Identify the physical property of each object.
        [rigid, bendalbe, foldable, compressible, plastic(irreversibly deformable)]   
        1.

A: 
---template start---

1. Description
   - The scene contains a plush dragon, a red box, a small plastic bottle, a green cylindrical object, a wooden stick, and a transparent plastic disc.
   - Identify the physical property of each object.
     1. Plush dragon: compressible
     2. Red box: rigid
     3. Plastic bottle: plastic (irreversibly deformable)
     4. Green cylindrical object: compressible
     5. Wooden stick: bendable
     6. Transparent plastic disc: plastic (irreversibly deformable)

2. Grounded Plan
   1. Pick the plush dragon.
   2. Place the plush dragon into the box.
   3. Push the plush dragon.
   4. Pick the green cylindrical object.
   5. Place the green cylindrical object into the box.
   6. Push the green cylindrical object.
   7. Pick the wooden stick.
   8. Bend the wooden stick.
   9. Place the wooden stick into the box.
   10. Pick the red box.
   11. Place the red box into the box.
   12. Pick the plastic bottle.
   13. Place the plastic bottle into the box.
   14. Pick the transparent plastic disc.
   15. Place the transparent plastic disc into the box.
