Q: 
Goal of the bin_packing: Pack all the objects.

Available actions: 
pick: Pick an object that not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object. 
place: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object. 
bend: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action. 
push: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing. 
fold: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding. 

Constraints: 
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 


1. Describe the given images.
2. Create a plan that adheres to the given constraints and instructions.

A: 
---template start---

1. Description
   - Describe the objects in the scene.
     - A red dragon toy, a brown cup, a blue bottle, a red box, a green cylinder, a white stick, and a transparent disc.
   - Identify the physical property of each object.
     1. Red dragon toy: compressible
     2. Brown cup: compressible
     3. Blue bottle: plastic
     4. Red box: rigid
     5. Green cylinder: compressible
     6. White stick: bendable
     7. Transparent disc: plastic

   6. Push the brown cup.
   7. Pick the green cylinder.
   8. Place the green cylinder into the box.
   9. Push the green cylinder.
   10. Pick the blue bottle.
   11. Place the blue bottle into the box.
   12. Pick the transparent disc.
   13. Place the transparent disc into the box.
   14. Bend the white stick.
   15. Pick the white stick.
   16. Place the white stick into the box.
   17. Pick the red box.
