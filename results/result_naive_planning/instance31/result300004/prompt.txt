Q: 
Goal of the bin_packing: Pack all the objects.

Available actions: 
pick: Pick an object that not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object. 
place: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object. 
bend: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action. 
push: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing. 
fold: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding. 

Constraints: 
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 


1. Describe the given images.
2. Create a plan that adheres to the given constraints and instructions.

---template start---
1. Description 
    - Describe the objects in the scene.
    - Identify the physical property of each object.
        [rigid, bendalbe, foldable, compressible, plastic(irreversibly deformable)]   
        1. 
        2.
        3.

2. Grounded Plan

 
---template end---


A: 
---template start---
1. Description 
    - The scene contains a blue cylindrical object, a green cylindrical object, a blue foldable object, a bendable wire, and a metal pin.
    - Identify the physical property of each object.
        1. Blue cylindrical object: plastic (irreversibly deformable)
        2. Green cylindrical object: plastic (irreversibly deformable)
        3. Blue foldable object: foldable
        4. Bendable wire: bendable
        5. Metal pin: rigid

2. Grounded Plan

    1. **pick** the bendable wire
    2. **bend** the bendable wire
    3. **pick** the bendable wire
    4. **place** the bendable wire in the box
    5. **pick** the blue foldable object
    6. **fold** the blue foldable object
    7. **pick** the blue foldable object
    8. **place** the blue foldable object in the box
    9. **pick** the green cylindrical object
    10. **place** the green cylindrical object in the box
    11. **pick** the blue cylindrical object
    12. **place** the blue cylindrical object in the box
    13. **pick** the metal pin
    14. **place** the metal pin in the box
