Q: 
Goal of the bin_packing: Pack all the objects.

Available actions: 
pick: Pick an object that not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object. 
place: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object. 
bend: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action. 
push: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing. 
fold: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding. 

Constraints: 
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 


1. Describe the given images.
2. Create a plan that adheres to the given constraints and instructions.

---template start---
1. Description 
    - Describe the objects in the scene.
    - Identify the physical property of each object.
        [rigid, bendalbe, foldable, compressible, plastic(irreversibly deformable)]   
        1. 
        2.
        3.

2. Grounded Plan

A: 
---template start---

1. Description
   - The scene contains five objects: a blue cylindrical object, a green cylindrical object, a blue rectangular object, a black bendable object, and a metallic bendable object.
   - Identify the physical property of each object.
     1. Blue cylindrical object: plastic (irreversibly deformable)
     2. Green cylindrical object: plastic (irreversibly deformable)
     3. Blue rectangular object: foldable
     4. Black object: bendable
     5. Metallic object: bendable

2. Grounded Plan
   1. Pick the black bendable object.
   2. Bend the black bendable object.
   3. Pick the blue rectangular object.
   4. Fold the blue rectangular object.
   5. Pick the metallic bendable object.
   6. Bend the metallic bendable object.
   7. Pick the compressible object (not visible, assumed to be present).
   8. Place the compressible object into the box.
   9. Push the compressible object.
   10. Pick the blue cylindrical object.
   11. Place the blue cylindrical object into the box.
   12. Pick the green cylindrical object.
   13. Place the green cylindrical object into the box.
