Q: 
Goal of the bin_packing: Pack all the objects.

Available actions: 
pick: Pick an object that not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object. 
place: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object. 
bend: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action. 
push: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing. 
fold: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding. 

Constraints: 
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 


1. Describe the given images.
2. Create a plan that adheres to the given constraints and instructions.

---template start---
1. Description 
    - Describe the objects in the scene.
    - Identify the physical property of each object.
        [rigid, bendalbe, foldable, compressible, plastic(irreversibly deformable)]

A: 
---template start---

1. Description
   - The scene contains a variety of objects: a blue cylindrical object, a green cylindrical object, a blue rectangular object, a black bendable object, and a metallic wire.
   - Identify the physical property of each object.
     1. Blue cylindrical object: plastic (irreversibly deformable)
     2. Green cylindrical object: plastic (irreversibly deformable)
     3. Blue rectangular object: foldable
     4. Black object: bendable
     5. Metallic wire: rigid

2. Grounded Plan
   - **Pick** the black bendable object.
   - **Bend** the black bendable object.
   - **Pick** the blue rectangular foldable object.
   - **Fold** the blue rectangular foldable object.
   - **Pick** the compressible object (not visible, assumed to be present).
   - **Place** the compressible object into the box.
   - **Push** the compressible object.
   - **Pick** the blue cylindrical plastic object.
   - **Place** the blue cylindrical plastic object into the box.
   - **Pick** the green cylindrical plastic object.
   - **Place** the green cylindrical plastic object into the box.
   - **Pick** the metallic wire.
   - **Place** the metallic wire into the box.
