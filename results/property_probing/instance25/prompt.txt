Q:  
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.
Each view captures the same scene, with the objects in the images corresponding one-to-one between the two views.
I will provide you with images that have bounding boxes drawn around the objects and its logits. 
However, unfortunately, these images can occasionally contain errors. 
Therefore, you need to make accurate judgments about the objects' positions and relationships. 
Additionally, the white lines represent the relationships between the bounding boxes, so think of this as a graph.

Based on the spatial information from this graph, you should be able to recognize the same objects. 
Please describe the given environment based on these images.

### Objects and Their Descriptions:

# top view
|  top index  | descriptions  
|      1      | Blue cylindrical object with a white cap
|      2      | Yellow rectangular sponge with a yellow band
|      3      | Black curved object
|      4      | Green cylindrical object

# side view
|  side index  | descriptions
|       1      | Blue cylindrical object with a white cap
|       2      | Yellow rectangular sponge with a yellow band
|       3      | Black curved object
|       4      | Green cylindrical object

# Find same objects in both views 
- Blue cylindrical object with a white cap: top index 1, side index 1
- Yellow rectangular sponge with a yellow band: top index 2, side index 2
- Black curved object: top index 3, side index 3
- Green cylindrical object: top index 4, side index 4

### Spatial Relationships:
- The blue cylindrical object is positioned to the left of the yellow sponge in both views.
- The black curved object is below the blue cylindrical object and the yellow sponge.
- The green cylindrical object is to the right of the yellow sponge.

### Critical bounding box errors Description:
- No critical bounding box errors detected.

Q: 
Now that you've obtained the spatial information of the objects, you need to describe shape, color, and dimension of each object.
And for clarity, I will provide the original images. Please identify the shape, dimension, and color of each object based on these images according to the definitions in "[Definitions of dimensions and shapes]" below.
Your answer must follow the naming convention which is "color_dimension_shape" (e.g., red_3D_cuboid or black_2D_ring).
Ensure that there is no contradiction between the shape and dimension. For example, "1D" and "loop" or "3D" and "circle" are not compatible according to their definitions in "[Definitions of dimensions and shapes]".

[Definitions of dimensions and shapes]
Dimension
1D: One-dimensional object, such as thin and sharp thing
2D: Two-dimensional object, without height
3D: Three-dimensional object


Shape
1D
Line: A one-dimensional object characterized by a straight path connecting two endpoints, having a definite length but no width. If an object is with an empty center, it should not be a line.

2D
Circle: A two-dimensional round object with every point on its edge equidistant from its center
Rectangle: A two-dimensional polygonal object with opposite sides equal and four right angles
Triangle: A two-dimensional polygonal object with three sides and three angles
Polygon: A two-dimensional object with multiple straight sides (e.g., a pentagon is with 5 sides, a hexagon is with 6 sides)
Loop: A two-dimensional object with a closed curve characterized by an empty center, forming a continuous loop

3D
Sphere: A round three-dimensional object where every point on its surface is equidistant from its center
Cube: A three-dimensional object with six equal square faces
Cuboid: A three-dimensional object with six rectangular faces
Pyramid: A three-dimensional object with a polygonal base and triangular faces that converge to a single point
Cylinder: A three-dimensional object with two parallel circular bases connected by a curved surface
Cone: A three-dimensional object with a circular base that tapers to a single point
Polyhedron: A three-dimensional object with flat polygonal faces, straight edges, and vertices,

Descriptions about objects in the scene:
The scene contains four distinct objects. The blue object is a 3D cylinder with a white cap, characterized by its circular bases and curved surface. The yellow object is a 3D cuboid, resembling a sponge with a yellow band around it, having rectangular faces. The black object is a 1D line, appearing as a thin, curved piece. Lastly, the green object is a 3D cylinder, similar in shape to the blue object but larger, with circular bases and a curved surface. These objects are arranged on a wooden surface, with the blue cylinder positioned near the yellow cuboid, the black line below them, and the green cylinder to the right of the yellow cuboid. The objects vary in color and shape, providing a diverse set of items in the scene.
