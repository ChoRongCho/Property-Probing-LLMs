Q:  
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.
Each view captures the same scene, with the objects in the images corresponding one-to-one between the two views.
I will provide you with images that have bounding boxes drawn around the objects and its logits. 
However, unfortunately, these images can occasionally contain errors. 
Therefore, you need to make accurate judgments about the objects' positions and relationships. 
Additionally, the white lines represent the relationships between the bounding boxes, so think of this as a graph.

Based on the spatial information from this graph, you should be able to recognize the same objects. 
Please describe the given environment based on these images.

|  top index  | descriptions  
|      1      | Red dragon toy, top left
|      2      | Blue rectangular object, center
|      3      | Brown cup, top right
|      4      | Transparent circular lid, bottom left

|       2      | Blue rectangular object, center
|       3      | Brown cup, right
|       4      | Transparent circular lid, left
|       5      | Yellow rectangular sponge, front
|       6      | Small white bottle cap, right

# Find same objects in both views 
- Red dragon toy: top 1, side 1
- Blue rectangular object: top 2, side 2
- Brown cup: top 3, side 3
- Transparent circular lid: top 4, side 4
- Yellow rectangular sponge: top 5, side 5
- Small white bottle cap: top 6, side 6

### Spatial Relationships:
- The red dragon toy is connected to the blue rectangular object and the transparent circular lid.
- The blue rectangular object is centrally located and connected to all other objects.
- The brown cup is connected to the blue rectangular object and the small white bottle cap.
- The transparent circular lid is connected to the red dragon toy and the blue rectangular object.
- The yellow rectangular sponge is connected to the blue rectangular object and the small white bottle cap.
- The small white bottle cap is connected to the blue rectangular object and the brown cup.

### Critical bounding box errors Description:
- No critical bounding box errors detected.

Q: 
Now that you've obtained the spatial information of the objects, you need to describe shape, color, and dimension of each object.
And for clarity, I will provide the original images. Please identify the shape, dimension, and color of each object based on these images according to the definitions in "[Definitions of dimensions and shapes]" below.
Your answer must follow the naming convention which is "color_dimension_shape" (e.g., red_3D_cuboid or black_2D_ring).
Ensure that there is no contradiction between the shape and dimension. For example, "1D" and "loop" or "3D" and "circle" are not compatible according to their definitions in "[Definitions of dimensions and shapes]".

[Definitions of dimensions and shapes]
Dimension
1D: One-dimensional object, such as thin and sharp thing
2D: Two-dimensional object, without height
3D: Three-dimensional object


Shape
1D
Line: A one-dimensional object characterized by a straight path connecting two endpoints, having a definite length but no width. If an object is with an empty center, it should not be a line.

2D
Circle: A two-dimensional round object with every point on its edge equidistant from its center
Rectangle: A two-dimensional polygonal object with opposite sides equal and four right angles
Triangle: A two-dimensional polygonal object with three sides and three angles
Polygon: A two-dimensional object with multiple straight sides (e.g., a pentagon is with 5 sides, a hexagon is with 6 sides)
Loop: A two-dimensional object with a closed curve characterized by an empty center, forming a continuous loop

3D
Sphere: A round three-dimensional object where every point on its surface is equidistant from its center
Cube: A three-dimensional object with six equal square faces
Cuboid: A three-dimensional object with six rectangular faces
Pyramid: A three-dimensional object with a polygonal base and triangular faces that converge to a single point
Cylinder: A three-dimensional object with two parallel circular bases connected by a curved surface
Cone: A three-dimensional object with a circular base that tapers to a single point
Polyhedron: A three-dimensional object with flat polygonal faces, straight edges, and vertices,

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The scene contains a variety of objects with distinct shapes and colors. The red object is a 3D polyhedron, resembling a dragon toy with complex features. The blue object is a 2D rectangle, flat and rectangular in shape. The brown object is a 3D cylinder, resembling a cup with a circular base and curved surface. The transparent object is a 2D circle, likely a lid, with a round shape and no height. The yellow object is a 2D rectangle, flat and rectangular, possibly a sponge. Lastly, the white object is a 3D cylinder, resembling a small bottle cap with a circular base and height. Each object is uniquely identifiable by its color, dimension, and shape, contributing to the diverse arrangement in the scene.
