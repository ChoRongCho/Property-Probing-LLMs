Q:  
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.
Each view captures the same scene, with the objects in the images corresponding one-to-one between the two views.
I will provide you with images that have bounding boxes drawn around the objects and its logits. 
However, unfortunately, these images can occasionally contain errors. 
Therefore, you need to make accurate judgments about the objects' positions and relationships. 
Additionally, the white lines represent the relationships between the bounding boxes, so think of this as a graph.

Based on the spatial information from this graph, you should be able to recognize the same objects. 
Please describe the given environment based on these images.

### Objects and Their Descriptions:

# top view
|  top index  | descriptions  
|      1      | Red cube
|      2      | Yellow sponge
|      3      | Red dragon toy
|      4      | Blue cylindrical object
|      5      | White stick

# side view
|  side index  | descriptions
|       1      | Yellow sponge
|       2      | Red cube
|       3      | Red dragon toy
|       4      | Blue cylindrical object
|       5      | White stick

# Find same objects in both views 
- Red cube: top index 1, side index 2
- Yellow sponge: top index 2, side index 1
- Red dragon toy: top index 3, side index 3
- Blue cylindrical object: top index 4, side index 4
- White stick: top index 5, side index 5

### Spatial Relationships:
- The red cube is centrally located in both views.
- The yellow sponge is to the left of the red cube in both views.
- The red dragon toy is to the right of the red cube in both views.
- The blue cylindrical object is below the red cube in the top view and in front of it in the side view.
- The white stick is below the blue cylindrical object in both views.

### Critical bounding box errors Description:
- No critical bounding box errors detected.

Q: 
Now that you've obtained the spatial information of the objects, you need to describe shape, color, and dimension of each object.
And for clarity, I will provide the original images. Please identify the shape, dimension, and color of each object based on these images according to the definitions in "[Definitions of dimensions and shapes]" below.
Your answer must follow the naming convention which is "color_dimension_shape" (e.g., red_3D_cuboid or black_2D_ring).
Ensure that there is no contradiction between the shape and dimension. For example, "1D" and "loop" or "3D" and "circle" are not compatible according to their definitions in "[Definitions of dimensions and shapes]".

[Definitions of dimensions and shapes]
Dimension
1D: One-dimensional object, such as thin and sharp thing
2D: Two-dimensional object, without height
3D: Three-dimensional object


Shape
1D
Line: A one-dimensional object characterized by a straight path connecting two endpoints, having a definite length but no width. If an object is with an empty center, it should not be a line.

2D
Circle: A two-dimensional round object with every point on its edge equidistant from its center
Rectangle: A two-dimensional polygonal object with opposite sides equal and four right angles
Triangle: A two-dimensional polygonal object with three sides and three angles
Polygon: A two-dimensional object with multiple straight sides (e.g., a pentagon is with 5 sides, a hexagon is with 6 sides)
Loop: A two-dimensional object with a closed curve characterized by an empty center, forming a continuous loop

3D
Sphere: A round three-dimensional object where every point on its surface is equidistant from its center
Cube: A three-dimensional object with six equal square faces
Cuboid: A three-dimensional object with six rectangular faces
Pyramid: A three-dimensional object with a polygonal base and triangular faces that converge to a single point
Cylinder: A three-dimensional object with two parallel circular bases connected by a curved surface
Cone: A three-dimensional object with a circular base that tapers to a single point
Polyhedron: A three-dimensional object with flat polygonal faces, straight edges, and vertices,

Descriptions about objects in the scene:
The scene contains five distinct objects. The red object is a 3D cuboid, characterized by its rectangular faces, and is centrally located. The yellow object is also a 3D cuboid, with a spongy texture and a yellow band around it. The red dragon toy is a 3D polyhedron, with complex shapes and features like wings and a tail, making it more intricate than a simple geometric shape. The blue object is a 3D cylinder, identifiable by its circular base and curved surface, and it appears to be a container with a white cap. Lastly, the white object is a 1D line, a thin and straight stick-like object, lying horizontally in the scene. Each object is distinct in color and shape, contributing to a diverse arrangement on the wooden surface.
