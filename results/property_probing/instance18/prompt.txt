Q:  
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.
Each view captures the same scene, with the objects in the images corresponding one-to-one between the two views.
I will provide you with images that have bounding boxes drawn around the objects and its logits. 
However, unfortunately, these images can occasionally contain errors. 
Therefore, you need to make accurate judgments about the objects' positions and relationships. 
Additionally, the white lines represent the relationships between the bounding boxes, so think of this as a graph.

Based on the spatial information from this graph, you should be able to recognize the same objects. 
Please describe the given environment based on these images.

### Objects and Their Descriptions:
# top view
|  top index  | descriptions  
|      1      |  
|      2      |

# side view
|  side index  | descriptions
|       1      |  
|       2      |

# Find same objects in both views 


### Spatial Relationships:

### Critical bounding box errors Description:
# if there is any critical error such as wrong bonding box and additional bounding box, describe here

### Objects and Their Descriptions:

# top view
|  top index  | descriptions  
|      1      | Rectangular foam block, white, positioned at the top left
|      2      | Blue rectangular card, positioned at the top right
|      3      | Blue cylindrical container, positioned at the bottom left
|      4      | Metal drill bit, positioned at the bottom center

# side view
|  side index  | descriptions
|       1      | Rectangular foam block, white, positioned at the back left
|       2      | Blue rectangular card, positioned at the back right
|       3      | Blue cylindrical container, positioned at the front left
|       4      | Metal drill bit, positioned at the front center

# Find same objects in both views 
- Top view 1 corresponds to Side view 1
- Top view 2 corresponds to Side view 2
- Top view 3 corresponds to Side view 3
- Top view 4 corresponds to Side view 4

### Spatial Relationships:
- The foam block and the blue card are positioned at the back in the side view and at the top in the top view.
- The cylindrical container and the drill bit are positioned at the front in the side view and at the bottom in the top view.
- The white lines indicate connections between the foam block, blue card, cylindrical container, and drill bit, forming a quadrilateral.

### Critical bounding box errors Description:
- No critical bounding box errors detected.

Q: 
Now that you've obtained the spatial information of the objects, you need to describe shape, color, and dimension of each object.
And for clarity, I will provide the original images. Please identify the shape, dimension, and color of each object based on these images according to the definitions in "[Definitions of dimensions and shapes]" below.
Your answer must follow the naming convention which is "color_dimension_shape" (e.g., red_3D_cuboid or black_2D_ring).
Ensure that there is no contradiction between the shape and dimension. For example, "1D" and "loop" or "3D" and "circle" are not compatible according to their definitions in "[Definitions of dimensions and shapes]".

[Definitions of dimensions and shapes]
Dimension
1D: One-dimensional object, such as thin and sharp thing
2D: Two-dimensional object, without height
3D: Three-dimensional object


Shape
1D
Line: A one-dimensional object characterized by a straight path connecting two endpoints, having a definite length but no width. If an object is with an empty center, it should not be a line.

2D
Circle: A two-dimensional round object with every point on its edge equidistant from its center
Rectangle: A two-dimensional polygonal object with opposite sides equal and four right angles
Triangle: A two-dimensional polygonal object with three sides and three angles
Polygon: A two-dimensional object with multiple straight sides (e.g., a pentagon is with 5 sides, a hexagon is with 6 sides)
Loop: A two-dimensional object with a closed curve characterized by an empty center, forming a continuous loop

3D
Sphere: A round three-dimensional object where every point on its surface is equidistant from its center
Cube: A three-dimensional object with six equal square faces
Cuboid: A three-dimensional object with six rectangular faces
Pyramid: A three-dimensional object with a polygonal base and triangular faces that converge to a single point
Cylinder: A three-dimensional object with two parallel circular bases connected by a curved surface
Cone: A three-dimensional object with a circular base that tapers to a single point
Polyhedron: A three-dimensional object with flat polygonal faces, straight edges, and vertices,

object: red_3D_polyhedron, yellow_3D_cuboid, ... # if there are duplicate objects, add '_N' at the end, e.g., red_3D_cuboid_2.

Descriptions about objects in the scene:
The scene contains four distinct objects. The first object is a white 3D cuboid, which appears to be a foam block with a rectangular shape and three-dimensional form. The second object is a blue 2D rectangle, likely a flat card or sheet, characterized by its two-dimensional nature and rectangular shape. The third object is a blue 3D cylinder, which is a cylindrical container with a circular base and a curved surface, giving it a three-dimensional form. Lastly, there is a silver 1D line, which is a thin, elongated object resembling a drill bit, characterized by its one-dimensional nature. These objects are arranged on a wooden surface, with the foam block and blue card positioned towards the back, and the cylindrical container and drill bit towards the front.
