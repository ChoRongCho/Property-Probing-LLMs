Q:  
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.
Each view captures the same scene, with the objects in the images corresponding one-to-one between the two views.
I will provide you with images that have bounding boxes drawn around the objects and its logits. 
However, unfortunately, these images can occasionally contain errors. 
Therefore, you need to make accurate judgments about the objects' positions and relationships. 
Additionally, the white lines represent the relationships between the bounding boxes, so think of this as a graph.

Based on the spatial information from this graph, you should be able to recognize the same objects. 
Please describe the given environment based on these images.

|      1      | Yellow sponge with a yellow band
|      2      | White rectangular sponge
|      3      | Brown cup-shaped object

|       3      | Brown cup-shaped object
|       4      | Transparent bottle
|       5      | Yellow rectangular sheet

# Find same objects in both views 
- Yellow sponge with a yellow band: top 1, side 1
- White rectangular sponge: top 2, side 2
- Brown cup-shaped object: top 3, side 3
- Transparent bottle: top 4, side 4
- Yellow rectangular sheet: top 5, side 5

### Spatial Relationships:
- The yellow sponge is adjacent to the white rectangular sponge and the transparent bottle.
- The white rectangular sponge is between the yellow sponge and the brown cup-shaped object.
- The brown cup-shaped object is next to the white rectangular sponge and above the yellow rectangular sheet.
- The transparent bottle is next to the yellow sponge and above the yellow rectangular sheet.
- The yellow rectangular sheet is below the brown cup-shaped object and the transparent bottle.

### Critical bounding box errors Description:
- No critical bounding box errors detected.

Q: 
Now that you've obtained the spatial information of the objects, you need to describe shape, color, and dimension of each object.
And for clarity, I will provide the original images. Please identify the shape, dimension, and color of each object based on these images according to the definitions in "[Definitions of dimensions and shapes]" below.
Your answer must follow the naming convention which is "color_dimension_shape" (e.g., red_3D_cuboid or black_2D_ring).
Ensure that there is no contradiction between the shape and dimension. For example, "1D" and "loop" or "3D" and "circle" are not compatible according to their definitions in "[Definitions of dimensions and shapes]".

[Definitions of dimensions and shapes]
Dimension
1D: One-dimensional object, such as thin and sharp thing
2D: Two-dimensional object, without height
3D: Three-dimensional object


Shape
1D
Line: A one-dimensional object characterized by a straight path connecting two endpoints, having a definite length but no width. If an object is with an empty center, it should not be a line.

2D
Circle: A two-dimensional round object with every point on its edge equidistant from its center
Rectangle: A two-dimensional polygonal object with opposite sides equal and four right angles
Triangle: A two-dimensional polygonal object with three sides and three angles
Polygon: A two-dimensional object with multiple straight sides (e.g., a pentagon is with 5 sides, a hexagon is with 6 sides)
Loop: A two-dimensional object with a closed curve characterized by an empty center, forming a continuous loop

3D
Sphere: A round three-dimensional object where every point on its surface is equidistant from its center
Cube: A three-dimensional object with six equal square faces
Cuboid: A three-dimensional object with six rectangular faces
Pyramid: A three-dimensional object with a polygonal base and triangular faces that converge to a single point
Cylinder: A three-dimensional object with two parallel circular bases connected by a curved surface
Cone: A three-dimensional object with a circular base that tapers to a single point
Polyhedron: A three-dimensional object with flat polygonal faces, straight edges, and vertices,

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The scene contains five distinct objects. The first object is a yellow 3D cuboid, which appears to be a sponge with a yellow band around it. The second object is a white 3D cuboid, resembling a rectangular sponge. The third object is a brown 3D cylinder, which looks like a cup-shaped container. The fourth object is a transparent 3D cuboid, likely a small bottle. Lastly, there is a yellow 2D rectangle, which appears to be a flat sheet. Each object is clearly distinguishable by its color, shape, and dimension, fitting neatly into the provided classification system. The objects are arranged on a wooden surface, showcasing a variety of shapes and colors that are easily identifiable. The yellow cuboid and white cuboid are similar in shape but differ in color, while the brown cylinder stands out due to its distinct shape. The transparent cuboid adds a unique element with its see-through appearance, and the yellow rectangle provides a flat contrast to the other three-dimensional objects.
