    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:

    # object1.is_plastic is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object2.is_foldable is True, actions pick, place, fold are applicable

    # !!Note1: Common Mistakes! pick -> fold -> place (x), fold -> pick -> place (o) 
    # !!Note2: Do not assume or change the physical properties of the object.
    # 1. Fold object2 (yellow_2D_rectangle) and object3 (transparent_2D_circle) before picking and placing them.
    # 2. Pick and place object4 (brown_3D_cylinder) first, then push it.
    # 3. Pick and place object0 (white_3D_cuboid).
    # 4. Pick and place object2 (yellow_2D_rectangle).
    # 5. Pick and place object3 (transparent_2D_circle).
    # 6. Pick and place object1 (blue_2D_rectangle) after object4 is in the box.

    # The sequence ensures all objects are packed according to their properties and constraints.
