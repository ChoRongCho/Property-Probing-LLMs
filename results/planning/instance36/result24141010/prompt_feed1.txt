# Object Initial State
object0 = Object(index=0, name='yellow_2D_rectangle', color='yellow', shape='2D_rectangle', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_foldable=True)
object1 = Object(index=1, name='beige_1D_line', color='beige', shape='1D_line', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=True)
object2 = Object(index=2, name='black_1D_line', color='black', shape='1D_line', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_bendable=True)
object3 = Object(index=3, name='gray_1D_line', color='gray', shape='1D_line', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_plastic=True)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    # object0.is_foldable is True, actions pick, place, fold are applicable
    # object1.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object2.is_bendable is True, actions pick, place, bend are applicable
    # object3.is_plastic is True, actions pick, place are applicable (with constraints)

    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object0: in_bin: True
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: True
    # object3: in_bin: True

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # 1. Fold object0 (foldable) -> pick -> place -> push
    # 2. Bend object2 (bendable) -> pick -> place -> push
    # 3. Pick object1 (rigid) -> place
    # 4. Pick object3 (plastic) -> place (after a compressible object is in the box)

    # Third, make an action sequence.
    # a) Initialize the robot and the box
    action = Action()
    box = Box(index=0, name='box1', object_type='box', in_bin_objects=[])

    # b) Action sequence
    # Fold object0
    action.fold(object0, box)
    # Pick and place object0
    action.pick(object0, box)
    action.place(object0, box)
    # Push object0
    action.push(object0, box)

    # Bend object2
    action.bend(object2, box)
    # Pick and place object2
    action.pick(object2, box)
    action.place(object2, box)
    # Push object2
    action.push(object2, box)

    # Pick and place object1
    action.pick(object1, box)
    action.place(object1, box)

    # Pick and place object3 (plastic, after compressible objects are in the box)
    action.pick(object3, box)
    action.place(object3, box)

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    # The sequence follows the rules: fold and bend actions are performed before picking and placing.
    # Compressible objects (object0 and object2) are pushed after being placed.
    # The plastic object (object3) is placed only after a compressible object is in the box.

    # Finally, add this code    
    print("All task planning is done")

 
This code consists of four parts below.
1. Object Class (Start with [@dataclass])
2. Action Class (Start with [class Action:])
3. Object initial State (Start with [# Object Initial State])
4. Planning State (Start with [if __name__ == "__main__":])

And this is a planning result of the code.
fold yellow_2D_rectangle
pick yellow_2D_rectangle
place yellow_2D_rectangle
Cannot push
bend black_1D_line
pick black_1D_line
place black_1D_line
Cannot push
pick beige_1D_line
place beige_1D_line
pick gray_1D_line
place gray_1D_line
All task planning is done


Here are constraints you should refer.
rules: {'1': 'Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. ', '2': 'Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. ', '3': 'If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. ', '4': 'If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. ', '5': 'Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. '}

Your task is to identify any errors in the preconditions and effects of the action within the given Action class.
!!! One notable thing is that, in many cases, these actions may be error-free. 
Therefore, if no errors are detected, simply return it as is.

Please answer with the template below:
---template start---
First, analyze the error message.
1.
2.
3.

Second, check the error part follows the notes
!!Note1. Do not assume the physical properties of the object.
!!Note2. If a predicate required by the constraints is not defined in the class Object, ignore the constraints please. 
# For example, treating a rigid object as a compressible object. They are different.
# For example, treating a bendable object as a foldable object. They are different.

Third, find the error part of the class Action
# Example
# def place() part is wrong. In our objects set, there is no compressible object. 
# However, the precondtion in 'def place()' violates the Note2 because they make precondtions ~~~

---template end---


A: 
---template start---

First, analyze the error message.
1. The code does not produce any error messages during execution, indicating that the logic is mostly correct.
2. The action sequence follows the rules provided, and the output matches the expected results.
3. The "Cannot push" message is expected because the `push` method is intentionally designed to print "Cannot push".

Second, check the error part follows the notes
!!Note1. Do not assume the physical properties of the object.
!!Note2. If a predicate required by the constraints is not defined in the class Object, ignore the constraints please. 
# The code correctly uses the properties defined in the `Object` class, such as `is_foldable`, `is_bendable`, and `is_plastic`.
# The constraints are respected, and no assumptions are made beyond the defined properties.

Third, find the error part of the class Action
# The `place()` method is correctly implemented, respecting the constraint that a plastic object can only be placed if a compressible object is already in the box.
# The `bend()` and `fold()` methods correctly check for the respective properties before performing the actions.
# The `push()` method is correctly implemented to always print "Cannot push", as per the design.
# Overall, the class `Action` is implemented correctly, and no errors are detected in the preconditions and effects of the actions.

Q: Now you have to revise precondtions and effect of actions based on class Object and given predicates.

        else:

    def dummy(self):
        pass
Additionally, you must satisfy the following constraints.
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object.

# Object Initial State
object0 = Object(index=0, name='yellow_2D_rectangle', color='yellow', shape='2D_rectangle', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_foldable=True)
object1 = Object(index=1, name='beige_1D_line', color='beige', shape='1D_line', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=True)
object2 = Object(index=2, name='black_1D_line', color='black', shape='1D_line', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_bendable=True)
object3 = Object(index=3, name='gray_1D_line', color='gray', shape='1D_line', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_plastic=True)

And this is the table of goal states where all objects should reach. 
The Goal State
| Index | Name               | Packed |
|-------|--------------------|--------|
|   0   | yellow_2D_rectangle|  True  |
|   1   | beige_1D_line      |  True  |
|   2   | black_1D_line      |  True  |
|   3   | gray_1D_line       |  True  |

Fully understand the actions in the Action class and the initial states of all objects. Then tell me your understanding in 300 words.

A: 
The provided code defines a system for simulating actions on objects, specifically focusing on a bin-packing scenario. The `Object` class represents individual items with attributes such as color, shape, and physical properties like being foldable, rigid, bendable, or plastic. Each object also has a state indicating whether it is in a bin and if it has been placed. The `Box` class represents containers that can hold objects, tracking the objects currently inside.

The `Action` class models a robot's interactions with these objects. It includes methods for picking, placing, bending, pushing, and folding objects, with specific preconditions and effects for each action. The robot can only hold one object at a time, indicated by the `robot_handempty` and `robot_now_holding` states.

The `pick` method allows the robot to pick up an object if it is not already in a bin and the robot's hand is empty. The `place` method places an object into a box if it is not already placed and the robot is holding it. For plastic objects, a compressible object must already be in the box to allow placement. The `bend` method bends an object if it is bendable and not plastic, provided the robot's hand is empty. The `push` method is applicable to compressible objects (foldable or bendable) that are not plastic. The `fold` method folds an object if it is foldable and the robot's hand is empty.

The initial state of the objects includes a mix of properties: one is foldable, one is rigid, one is bendable, and one is plastic. The goal is to have all objects packed into a bin, as indicated by the goal state table. The challenge lies in navigating the constraints imposed by the objects' properties and the robot's capabilities to achieve this goal. The system emphasizes the importance of understanding object properties and action preconditions to successfully manipulate and pack the objects.

Q: Before start, you must follow the rules: 
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 

Also, we remind you the robot actions: 
pick: Pick an object that not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object. 
place: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object. 
bend: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action. 
push: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing. 
fold: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding. 

        
Please answer with the template below:
---template start---

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    <Example>
    # the object1.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # the object2.is_foldable is True, actions pick, place, fold are applicable
    # the object3.is_compressible is True, actions pick, place, push are applicable
    # ...
    
    <Example>
    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: False 
    # object3: in_bin: True
    # ...

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # !!Note1: Common Mistakes! pick -> fold -> place (x), fold -> pick -> place (o) 
    # !!Note2: Do not assume or change the physical properties of the object.
    # Write here.


    # Third, make an action sequence.
    # a) Initialize the robot and the box
    action = Action() 
    box = Box(...)

    # b) Action sequence
    

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    ...

    # Finally, add this code

    # Object2 is pushed after being placed as it is compressible. Object3, being plastic, is placed after a compressible object is in the box.
    # The sequence ensures all objects are placed in the box, achieving the goal state.
