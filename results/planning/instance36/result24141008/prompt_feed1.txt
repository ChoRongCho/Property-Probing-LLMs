# Object Initial State
object0 = Object(index=0, name='yellow_2D_rectangle', color='yellow', shape='2D_rectangle', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_foldable=True)
object1 = Object(index=1, name='beige_1D_line', color='beige', shape='1D_line', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=True)

object3 = Object(index=3, name='gray_1D_line', color='gray', shape='1D_line', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_plastic=True)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    # object0.is_foldable is True, actions pick, place, fold are applicable
    # object1.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object2.is_bendable is True, actions pick, place, bend are applicable
    # object3.is_plastic is True, actions pick, place are applicable (with constraints)

    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object0: in_bin: True
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: True
    # object3: in_bin: True

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # 1. Fold object0 (foldable) before placing.
    # 2. Pick and place object0.
    # 3. Push object0 (compressible).
    # 4. Bend object2 (bendable) before placing.
    # 5. Pick and place object2.
    # 6. Pick and place object1 (no constraints).
    # 7. Pick and place object3 (plastic, requires compressible object already in the box).

    # Third, make an action sequence.
    # a) Initialize the robot and the box
    action = Action() 
    box = Box(index=0, name='box1', object_type='box', in_bin_objects=[])

    # b) Action sequence
    action.fold(object0, box)
    action.pick(object0, box)
    action.place(object0, box)
    action.push(object0, box)
    
    action.bend(object2, box)
    action.pick(object2, box)
    action.place(object2, box)
    
    action.pick(object1, box)
    action.place(object1, box)
    
    action.pick(object3, box)
    action.place(object3, box)

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    # The sequence follows the rules: fold and push compressible objects, bend bendable objects before placing,
    # and ensure a compressible object is in the box before placing a plastic object. The order respects the constraints
    # and ensures all objects are placed in the box as per the goal states.

    # Finally, add this code    
    print("All task planning is done")

 
This code consists of four parts below.
1. Object Class (Start with [@dataclass])
2. Action Class (Start with [class Action:])
3. Object initial State (Start with [# Object Initial State])
4. Planning State (Start with [if __name__ == "__main__":])

And this is a planning result of the code.
fold yellow_2D_rectangle
pick yellow_2D_rectangle
place yellow_2D_rectangle
Cannot push
bend black_1D_line
pick black_1D_line
place black_1D_line
pick beige_1D_line
place beige_1D_line
pick gray_1D_line
place gray_1D_line
All task planning is done


Here are constraints you should refer.
rules: {'1': 'Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. ', '2': 'Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. ', '3': 'If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. ', '4': 'If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. ', '5': 'Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. '}

Your task is to identify any errors in the preconditions and effects of the action within the given Action class.
!!! One notable thing is that, in many cases, these actions may be error-free. 
Therefore, if no errors are detected, simply return it as is.

Please answer with the template below:
---template start---
First, analyze the error message.
1.
2.
3.

Second, check the error part follows the notes
!!Note1. Do not assume the physical properties of the object.
!!Note2. If a predicate required by the constraints is not defined in the class Object, ignore the constraints please. 
# For example, treating a rigid object as a compressible object. They are different.
# For example, treating a bendable object as a foldable object. They are different.

Third, find the error part of the class Action
# Example
# def place() part is wrong. In our objects set, there is no compressible object. 
# However, the precondtion in 'def place()' violates the Note2 because they make precondtions ~~~

---template end---


A: 
---template start---

First, analyze the error message.
1. The planning result shows "Cannot push" for the object `yellow_2D_rectangle`, which is expected because the `push` method is not implemented to perform any action.
2. The sequence of actions seems to follow the constraints provided, with the exception of the `push` action, which is not applicable to any objects in the current setup.
3. The final output "All task planning is done" indicates that the sequence completes without any runtime errors.

Second, check the error part follows the notes
!!Note1. Do not assume the physical properties of the object.
!!Note2. If a predicate required by the constraints is not defined in the class Object, ignore the constraints please. 
# For example, treating a rigid object as a compressible object. They are different.
# For example, treating a bendable object as a foldable object. They are different.

Third, find the error part of the class Action
# The `push` method is not applicable to any objects in the current setup, as none of the objects are defined as compressible.
# The `place` method checks for a compressible object before placing a plastic object, which is correct according to the constraints.
# The `bend` and `fold` methods are correctly implemented to ensure the robot's hand is empty before and after the action.
# Overall, the class Action methods are correctly implemented according to the given constraints and object properties.

Q: Now you have to revise precondtions and effect of actions based on class Object and given predicates. 

class Action:
    def __init__(self, name: str = "UR5"):
        self.name = name    
        self.robot_handempty = True

            print(f"pick {obj.name}")
            # Effects: The robot is now holding the object, and the hand is no longer empty.
            self.state_holding(obj)
        else:
            print(f"Cannot pick {obj.name}")

    def place(self, obj, box):
        # Action Description: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object.
        # Check if the object is already in the bin or placed
        if not obj.in_bin and not obj.is_placed:
            # Check if the object is plastic and if the constraint applies
            if obj.is_plastic:

                compressible_present = any(o.is_foldable for o in box.in_bin_objects)
                if not compressible_present:
                    print(f"Cannot place {obj.name} because a compressible object is required first.")
                    return

            # Place the object in the box
            print(f"place {obj.name}")
            obj.is_placed = True
            obj.in_bin = True
            box.in_bin_objects.append(obj)
            self.state_handempty()
        else:
            print(f"Cannot place {obj.name} because it is already placed or in the bin.")

    def bend(self, obj, box):
        # Action Description: Bend a bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action.
        # Note! If a predicate required by the constraints is absent from the class Object, do not consider the constraints.
        if self.robot_handempty and obj.is_bendable and not obj.is_plastic:
            print(f"bend {obj.name}")
            # Effects of the action
            self.state_handempty()  # Ensure the hand remains empty after bending
        else:
            print(f"Cannot bend {obj.name}")

    def push(self, obj, box):
        print('Cannot push')

    def fold(self, obj, box):
        # Check if the object is foldable and the robot's hand is empty
        if obj.is_foldable and self.robot_handempty:
            # Action Description: Fold a foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding.
            print(f"fold {obj.name}")
            # Effects: The robot's hand remains empty, and the object is marked as folded (if applicable)
            self.state_handempty()
        else:
            print(f"Cannot fold {obj.name}")

    def dummy(self):
        pass
Additionally, you must satisfy the following constraints.
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 
Please revise pre-conditions and effect of the action

A: 
The provided code defines a system for simulating a bin-packing scenario using a robot arm, represented by the `Action` class, which interacts with objects and boxes. The `Object` class models the properties and states of individual items, while the `Box` class represents containers that can hold these objects.

Each `Object` has attributes such as `index`, `name`, `color`, `shape`, and `object_type`, which describe its identity and physical characteristics. Additionally, objects have boolean attributes like `in_bin`, `is_foldable`, `is_rigid`, `is_bendable`, and `is_plastic`, which define their current state and physical properties. The `is_placed` attribute indicates whether an object has been successfully placed in a box.

The `Action` class simulates the robot's capabilities, with methods for picking, placing, bending, pushing, and folding objects. The robot can only pick an object if it is not already in a bin and if its hand is empty. Placing an object requires it not to be in a bin or already placed, and if the object is plastic, a compressible object must be present in the box. Bending is allowed for bendable, non-plastic objects when the robot's hand is empty. Pushing is specific to foldable objects already in a bin, while folding is possible for foldable objects when the robot's hand is empty.

The initial state of the objects includes a yellow 2D rectangle that is foldable, a beige 1D line that is rigid, a black 1D line that is bendable, and a gray 1D line that is plastic. The goal is to have all objects packed in a box, indicated by their `in_bin` attribute being `True`.

The challenge lies in sequencing the actions to transition all objects from their initial states to the goal state, considering the constraints and dependencies defined by the object's properties and the robot's capabilities.

Q: Before start, you must follow the rules: 
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 

Also, we remind you the robot actions: 
pick: Pick an object that not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object. 
place: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object. 
bend: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action. 
push: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing. 
fold: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding. 

        
Please answer with the template below:
---template start---

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    <Example>
    # the object1.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # the object2.is_foldable is True, actions pick, place, fold are applicable
    # the object3.is_compressible is True, actions pick, place, push are applicable
    # ...
    
    <Example>
    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: False 
    # object3: in_bin: True
    # ...

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # !!Note1: Common Mistakes! pick -> fold -> place (x), fold -> pick -> place (o) 
    # !!Note2: Do not assume or change the physical properties of the object.
    # Write here.


    # Third, make an action sequence.
    # a) Initialize the robot and the box
    action = Action() 
    box = Box(...)

    # b) Action sequence
    

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    ...

    # Finally, add this code    
    print("All task planning is done")

A: 
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    # object0 is foldable, actions pick, place, fold are applicable
    # object1 is rigid, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object2 is bendable, actions pick, place, bend are applicable
    # object3 is plastic, actions pick, place are applicable (requires a compressible object in the box first)

    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object0: in_bin: True
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: True
    # object3: in_bin: True

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # 1. Fold object0 (foldable)
    # 2. Pick and place object0
    # 3. Push object0 (compressible)
    # 4. Bend object2 (bendable)
    # 5. Pick and place object2
    # 6. Pick and place object1 (rigid)
    # 7. Pick and place object3 (plastic, requires compressible object0 in the box first)

    # Third, make an action sequence.
    # a) Initialize the robot and the box
    action = Action()
    box = Box(index=0, name='box1', object_type='box', in_bin_objects=[])

    # b) Action sequence
    action.fold(object0, box)
    action.pick(object0, box)
    action.place(object0, box)
    action.push(object0, box)
    action.bend(object2, box)
    action.pick(object2, box)
    action.place(object2, box)
    action.pick(object1, box)
    action.place(object1, box)
    action.pick(object3, box)
    action.place(object3, box)

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    # The sequence follows the rules: object0 is folded and pushed as it is foldable and compressible.
    # Object2 is bent before placing as it is bendable. Object3 is placed last after object0 is in the box,
    # satisfying the requirement for a compressible object. Object1 is placed without additional actions
    # as it is rigid and non-plastic.

    # Finally, add this code    
    print("All task planning is done")
```
