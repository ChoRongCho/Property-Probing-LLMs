    # object2.is_bendable is True, actions pick, place, bend are applicable

    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: True
    # object3: in_bin: True

    # 1. Fold object0 (yellow_2D_rectangle) before placing it.
    # 2. Pick and place object0 into the box.
    # 3. Pick and place object1 (beige_1D_line) into the box.

    # 5. Pick and place object2 into the box.
    # 6. Pick and place object3 (gray_1D_line) into the box. Ensure a compressible object is in the box first.

    # and plastic objects are placed after ensuring a compressible object is already in the box. The sequence ensures that
    # all objects are placed in the box according to their properties and constraints.
