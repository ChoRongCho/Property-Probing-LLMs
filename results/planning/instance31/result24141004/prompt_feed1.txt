# Object Initial State
object0 = Object(index=0, name='blue_3D_cylinder', color='blue', shape='3D_cylinder', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=True, is_bendable=False, is_plastic=False, is_heavy=False)
object1 = Object(index=1, name='blue_2D_rectangle', color='blue', shape='2D_rectangle', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=False, is_bendable=False, is_plastic=True, is_heavy=False)
object2 = Object(index=2, name='black_1D_line', color='black', shape='1D_line', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=False, is_bendable=True, is_plastic=False, is_heavy=False)
object3 = Object(index=3, name='gray_1D_line', color='gray', shape='1D_line', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=False, is_bendable=False, is_plastic=True, is_heavy=False)
object4 = Object(index=4, name='green_3D_cylinder', color='green', shape='3D_cylinder', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=True, is_bendable=False, is_plastic=False, is_heavy=False)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    # object0 is rigid, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object1 is plastic, actions pick, place are applicable (needs compressible object in box first)
    # object2 is bendable, actions pick, place, bend are applicable
    # object3 is plastic, actions pick, place are applicable (needs compressible object in box first)
    # object4 is rigid, actions pick, place are applicable

    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object0: in_bin: True
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: True
    # object3: in_bin: True
    # object4: in_bin: True

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # 1. Bend object2 (bendable)
    # 2. Pick and place object2 (bendable)
    # 3. Pick and place object0 (rigid)
    # 4. Pick and place object4 (rigid)
    # 5. Pick and place object1 (plastic, after object2 is in the box)
    # 6. Pick and place object3 (plastic, after object2 is in the box)

    # Third, make an action sequence.
    # a) Initialize the robot and the box
    action = Action()
    box = Box(index=0, name='box', object_type='box', in_bin_objects=[])

    # b) Action sequence
    action.bend(object2, box)
    action.pick(object2, box)
    action.place(object2, box)

    action.pick(object0, box)
    action.place(object0, box)

    action.pick(object4, box)
    action.place(object4, box)

    action.pick(object1, box)
    action.place(object1, box)

    action.pick(object3, box)
    action.place(object3, box)

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    # Object2 is bendable, so it is bent before being placed in the box.
    # Object2 is placed first to satisfy the rule that a compressible object must be in the box before placing plastic objects.
    # Object0 and object4 are rigid and can be placed without constraints.
    # Object1 and object3 are plastic and require a compressible object (object2) to be in the box first.

    # Finally, add this code    
    print("All task planning is done")

 
This code consists of four parts below.
1. Object Class (Start with [@dataclass])
2. Action Class (Start with [class Action:])
3. Object initial State (Start with [# Object Initial State])
4. Planning State (Start with [if __name__ == "__main__":])

And this is a planning result of the code.
bend black_1D_line
pick black_1D_line
Cannot place black_1D_line
Cannot pick blue_3D_cylinder
Cannot place blue_3D_cylinder
Cannot pick green_3D_cylinder
Cannot place green_3D_cylinder
Cannot pick blue_2D_rectangle
Cannot place blue_2D_rectangle
Cannot pick gray_1D_line
Cannot place gray_1D_line
All task planning is done


Here are constraints you should refer.
rules: {'1': 'Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. ', '2': 'Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. ', '3': 'If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. ', '4': 'If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. ', '5': 'Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. '}

Your task is to identify any errors in the preconditions and effects of the action within the given Action class.
!!! One notable thing is that, in many cases, these actions may be error-free. 
Therefore, if no errors are detected, simply return it as is.

Please answer with the template below:
---template start---
First, analyze the error message.
1.
2.
3.

Second, check the error part follows the notes
!!Note1. Do not assume the physical properties of the object.
!!Note2. If a predicate required by the constraints is not defined in the class Object, ignore the constraints please. 
# For example, treating a rigid object as a compressible object. They are different.
# For example, treating a bendable object as a foldable object. They are different.

Third, find the error part of the class Action
# Example
# def place() part is wrong. In our objects set, there is no compressible object. 
# However, the precondtion in 'def place()' violates the Note2 because they make precondtions ~~~

---template end---


A: 
---template start---

First, analyze the error message.
1. The action sequence attempts to place `black_1D_line` (object2) in the box, but it fails with "Cannot place black_1D_line".
2. Subsequent attempts to pick and place other objects also fail, indicating a persistent issue with the preconditions or effects of the actions.
3. The final message "All task planning is done" indicates the sequence completed, but not successfully.

Second, check the error part follows the notes
!!Note1. Do not assume the physical properties of the object.
!!Note2. If a predicate required by the constraints is not defined in the class Object, ignore the constraints please. 
# For example, treating a rigid object as a compressible object. They are different.
# For example, treating a bendable object as a foldable object. They are different.

Third, find the error part of the class Action
# The error lies in the `place()` method of the Action class.
# Example
# def place() part is wrong. The precondition checks if `obj.in_bin` is False, but this is incorrect because the `pick()` method already sets `obj.in_bin = True` when an object is picked.
# Therefore, the `place()` method should not check `if not obj.in_bin` because it will always be False after a successful `pick()`.
# The correct precondition should only check if `self.robot_now_holding == obj`.

To fix the issue, update the `place()` method as follows:

```python
def place(self, obj, box):
    # Preconditions: The robot must be holding the object.
    if self.robot_now_holding == obj:
        # Place the object in the box
        print(f"place {obj.name}")
        
        # Effects: The object is now in the bin, and the robot's hand is empty.
        obj.in_bin = True
        box.in_bin_objects.append(obj)
        self.state_handempty()
    else:
        print(f"Cannot place {obj.name}")
```

---template end---
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Now you have to revise precondtions and effect of actions based on class Object and given predicates. 

class Action:
    def __init__(self, name: str = "UR5"):
        self.name = name    
        self.robot_handempty = True
        self.robot_now_holding = False

    # basic state
    def state_handempty(self):
        self.robot_handempty = True
        self.robot_now_holding = False

    # basic state
    def state_holding(self, obj):
        self.robot_handempty = False
        self.robot_now_holding = obj

    def pick(self, obj, box):
        # Preconditions: The robot's hand must be empty, and the object must not be in the box.
        if self.robot_handempty and not obj.in_bin:
            # Action Description: Pick an object that is not in the box.
            print(f"pick {obj.name}")
            # Effects: The robot is now holding the object, and the object is considered in the bin.
            self.state_holding(obj)
            obj.in_bin = True
            box.in_bin_objects.append(obj)
        else:
            print(f"Cannot pick {obj.name}")

    def place(self, obj, box):
        # Action Description: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object.
        # Note! If a predicate required by the constraints is absent from the class Object, do not consider the constraints.
        
        # Preconditions: The robot must be holding the object and the object must not already be in a bin.
        if self.robot_now_holding == obj and not obj.in_bin:
            # Check if the object is plastic and if so, ensure a compressible object is already in the box.
            # Since 'is_compressible' is not a property in the Object class, ignore this constraint.
            
            # Place the object in the box
            print(f"place {obj.name}")
            
            # Effects: The object is now in the bin, and the robot's hand is empty.
            obj.in_bin = True
            box.in_bin_objects.append(obj)
            self.state_handempty()
        else:
            print(f"Cannot place {obj.name}")

    def bend(self, obj, box):
        # Action Description: Bend a bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action.
        if self.robot_handempty and obj.is_bendable:
            print(f"bend {obj.name}")
            # Since the hand must remain empty, we ensure the robot's state reflects this
            self.state_handempty()
            # No change to the box or object state is necessary for bending alone
        else:
            print(f"Cannot bend {obj.name}")

    def push(self, obj, box):
        print('Cannot push')

    def fold(self, obj, box):
        print('Cannot fold')

    def dummy(self):
        pass
Additionally, you must satisfy the following constraints.
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 
Please revise pre-conditions and effect of the action

Fully understand the actions in the Action class and the initial states of all objects. Then tell me your understanding in 300 words.

A: 
The provided code defines a system for manipulating objects using a robotic arm, represented by the `Action` class. The `Object` class describes various objects with attributes such as color, shape, and physical properties like rigidity, bendability, and whether they are plastic or heavy. Each object also has a state indicating whether it is in a bin (`in_bin`). The `Box` class represents containers that can hold objects, tracking which objects are currently inside.

The `Action` class models the robot's capabilities, focusing on picking, placing, and bending objects. The robot can only pick an object if its hand is empty and the object is not already in a bin. Once picked, the robot's state changes to holding the object. The robot can place an object into a box only if it is currently holding it. The code mentions a constraint for placing plastic objects, which is ignored due to the absence of a relevant predicate in the `Object` class. The robot can bend objects if they are bendable and the robot's hand is empty, but bending does not change the object's state regarding the bin.

The initial state of the objects is defined, with all objects starting outside of any bin. The goal is to have all objects packed into a bin, as indicated by the goal state table where the `Packed` column is `True` for all objects. The `Action` class provides methods to achieve this goal by manipulating the objects according to their properties and the robot's current state.

Overall, the system is designed to simulate a simple bin-packing task, where the robot must efficiently move objects into a bin, considering their physical properties and the robot's constraints. The code provides a framework for understanding how different object properties affect the robot's ability to manipulate them, with a focus on achieving the goal state where all objects are packed.

Q: Before start, you must follow the rules: 
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 

Also, we remind you the robot actions: 
pick: Pick an object that not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object. 
place: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object. 
bend: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action. 
push: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing. 
fold: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding. 

        
Please answer with the template below:
---template start---

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    <Example>
    # the object1.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # the object2.is_foldable is True, actions pick, place, fold are applicable
    # the object3.is_compressible is True, actions pick, place, push are applicable
    # ...
    
    <Example>
    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: False 
    # object3: in_bin: True
    # ...

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # !!Note1: Common Mistakes! pick -> fold -> place (x), fold -> pick -> place (o) 
    # !!Note2: Do not assume or change the physical properties of the object.
    # Write here.


    # Third, make an action sequence.
    # a) Initialize the robot and the box
    action = Action() 
    box = Box(...)

    # b) Action sequence
    

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    ...

    # Finally, add this code    
    print("All task planning is done")

A: 
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    # object0: is_rigid=True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object1: is_plastic=True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object2: is_bendable=True, actions pick, place, bend are applicable
    # object3: is_plastic=True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object4: is_rigid=True, actions pick, place are applicable

    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object0: in_bin: True
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: True
    # object3: in_bin: True
    # object4: in_bin: True

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # 1. Bend object2 (black_1D_line) since it is bendable.
    # 2. Pick and place object2 into the box.
    # 3. Pick and place object0 (blue_3D_cylinder) since it is rigid.
    # 4. Pick and place object4 (green_3D_cylinder) since it is rigid.
    # 5. Pick and place object1 (blue_2D_rectangle) since it is plastic, after a compressible object is in the box.
    # 6. Pick and place object3 (gray_1D_line) since it is plastic, after a compressible object is in the box.

    # Third, make an action sequence.
    # a) Initialize the robot and the box
    action = Action()
    box = Box(index=0, name='box0', object_type='box', in_bin_objects=[])

    # b) Action sequence
    action.bend(object2, box)
    action.pick(object2, box)
    action.place(object2, box)

    action.pick(object0, box)
    action.place(object0, box)

    action.pick(object4, box)
    action.place(object4, box)

    action.pick(object1, box)
    action.place(object1, box)

    action.pick(object3, box)
    action.place(object3, box)

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    # The sequence follows the rules: bend the bendable object before placing it, ensure a compressible object is in the box before placing plastic objects, and do not bend, fold, or push plastic objects. The sequence ensures all objects are placed in the box according to their properties and constraints.

    # Finally, add this code    
    print("All task planning is done")
```
