    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:

This code consists of four parts below.
1. Object Class (Start with [@dataclass])
2. Action Class (Start with [class Action:])
3. Object initial State (Start with [# Object Initial State])
4. Planning State (Start with [if __name__ == "__main__":])

And this is a planning result of the code.

          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
TypeError: Box.__init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'object_type'


Identify any incorrect parts and revise the faulty sections based on the provided planning results.

---template start---
### Wrong part (Select only one from the planning result.)
1. Object Class 
2. Action Class 
3. Object initial State 
4. Planning State 

### Reason (Tell me your understanding in 300 words.)

### Revised version (Revise the wrong part selected above.)
```python
# 2. Action Class (example)
```
---template end---


A: 
### Wrong part
4. Planning State 

### Reason
The error message indicates that there is a missing required positional argument 'object_type' when trying to instantiate the `Box` class. The `Box` class is defined with three attributes: `index`, `name`, and `object_type`. However, in the `Planning State` section, when creating an instance of `Box`, only `index`, `name`, and `in_bin_objects` are provided, but `object_type` is missing. This is causing the `TypeError` because Python expects all required positional arguments to be provided when creating an instance of a class. The `object_type` attribute is crucial for the `Box` class, as it likely distinguishes between different types of objects or boxes, similar to the `Object` class. To fix this error, we need to provide a value for the `object_type` attribute when creating the `Box` instance. This will ensure that the `Box` class is instantiated correctly, and the program can proceed without encountering this error.

### Revised version
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    # object0: is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object1: is_plastic is True, actions pick, place are applicable (requires compressible object before placing)
    # object2: is_bendable is True, actions pick, place, bend are applicable
    # object3: is_plastic is True, actions pick, place are applicable (requires compressible object before placing)
    # object4: is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable

    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object0: in_bin: True
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: True
    # object3: in_bin: True
    # object4: in_bin: True

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # 1. Bend object2 (black_1D_line) since it is bendable.
    # 2. Pick and place object2 (black_1D_line) as it is bendable and non-plastic.
    # 3. Push object2 (black_1D_line) as it is compressible.
    # 4. Pick and place object0 (blue_3D_cylinder) as it is non-plastic.
    # 5. Pick and place object4 (green_3D_cylinder) as it is non-plastic.
    # 6. Pick and place object1 (blue_2D_rectangle) after a compressible object is in the box.
    # 7. Pick and place object3 (gray_1D_line) after a compressible object is in the box.

    # Third, make an action sequence.
    # a) Initialize the robot and the box
    action = Action() 
    box = Box(index=0, name="box", object_type="box", in_bin_objects=[])

    # b) Action sequence
    action.bend(object2, box)
    action.pick(object2, box)
    action.place(object2, box)
    action.push(object2, box)

    action.pick(object0, box)
    action.place(object0, box)

    action.pick(object4, box)
    action.place(object4, box)

    action.pick(object1, box)
    action.place(object1, box)

    action.pick(object3, box)
    action.place(object3, box)

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    # The sequence follows the rules: bend the bendable object first, place compressible objects before plastic ones,
    # and push compressible objects after placing them. Non-plastic objects are placed without constraints.
