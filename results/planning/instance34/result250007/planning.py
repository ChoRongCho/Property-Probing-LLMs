    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    # object0: is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object1: is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object2: is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # Note: No specific properties like compressible, bendable, or foldable are defined in the initial state.

    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object0: in_bin: True
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: True

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # Since no specific properties like compressible, bendable, or foldable are defined, we assume all objects are rigid.
    # The order can be arbitrary as there are no constraints like plastic or compressible objects.

    # Third, make an action sequence.
    # a) Initialize the robot and the box

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    # Since no objects are defined as plastic, compressible, bendable, or foldable, the actions are straightforward.
    # The robot picks each object and places it into the box without additional constraints.
    # The goal state is achieved as all objects are placed in the box.

    # Finally, add this code
