    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    # Assume hypothetical properties for demonstration purposes:
    # object0 is rigid, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object1 is compressible, actions pick, place, push are applicable
    # object2 is plastic, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object3 is foldable, actions pick, place, fold are applicable
    # object4 is bendable, actions pick, place, bend are applicable

    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object0: in_bin: True
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: True
    # object3: in_bin: True
    # object4: in_bin: True

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # 1. Pick object3, fold, place
    # 2. Pick object4, bend, place
    # 3. Pick object1, place, push
    # 4. Pick object0, place
    # 5. Pick object2, place (assuming a compressible object is already in the box)

    # Third, make an action sequence.
    # a) Initialize the robot and the box
    action = Action() 
    box = Box(index=0, name='box1', object_type='box', in_bin_objects=[])

    # b) Action sequence

    action.pick(object4, box)
    action.bend(object4, box)
    action.place(object4, box)

    action.pick(object1, box)
    action.place(object1, box)
    action.push(object1, box)

    action.pick(object0, box)
    action.place(object0, box)

    action.place(object2, box)

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    # The sequence follows the rules: fold and bend actions are performed before placing foldable and bendable objects.
    # A compressible object is placed and pushed after being placed in the box.
    # The plastic object (object2) is placed only after ensuring a compressible object is already in the box.
