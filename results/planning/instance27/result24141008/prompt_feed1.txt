# Object Initial State

object1 = Object(index=1, name='white_3D_cylinder', color='white', shape='3D_cylinder', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=False, is_compressible=True, is_3D=True)
object2 = Object(index=2, name='beige_1D_line', color='beige', shape='1D_line', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=True, is_compressible=False, is_3D=False)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    # object0.is_compressible is True, actions pick, place, push are applicable
    # object1.is_compressible is True, actions pick, place, push are applicable
    # object2.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object3.is_compressible is True, actions pick, place, push are applicable
    # object4.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable

    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object0: in_bin: True
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: True
    # object3: in_bin: True
    # object4: in_bin: True

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # 1. Pick and place all compressible objects first, then push them.
    # 2. Pick and place non-compressible objects.
    # Note: No objects are bendable or foldable, so those actions are not applicable.

    # Third, make an action sequence.
    # a) Initialize the robot and the box
    action = Action()
    box = Box(index=0, name='bin', object_type='box', in_bin_objects=[])

    # b) Action sequence
    # Pick, place, and push compressible objects
    action.pick(object0, box)
    action.place(object0, box)
    action.push(object0, box)

    action.pick(object1, box)
    action.place(object1, box)
    action.push(object1, box)

    action.pick(object3, box)
    action.place(object3, box)
    action.push(object3, box)

    # Pick and place non-compressible objects
    action.pick(object2, box)
    action.place(object2, box)

    action.pick(object4, box)
    action.place(object4, box)

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    # The compressible objects (object0, object1, object3) were placed first and pushed as required by the rules.
    # Non-compressible objects (object2, object4) were placed without additional actions since they are not bendable or foldable.
    # The sequence respects the constraints and ensures all objects are packed as per the goal states.

    # Finally, add this code    
    print("All task planning is done")

 
This code consists of four parts below.
1. Object Class (Start with [@dataclass])
2. Action Class (Start with [class Action:])
3. Object initial State (Start with [# Object Initial State])
4. Planning State (Start with [if __name__ == "__main__":])

And this is a planning result of the code.
pick yellow_3D_cuboid
Cannot place yellow_3D_cuboid, it is already in the bin.
Cannot push yellow_3D_cuboid
Cannot pick white_3D_cylinder
Cannot place white_3D_cylinder, the robot is not holding it.
Cannot push white_3D_cylinder
Cannot pick brown_3D_cylinder
Cannot place brown_3D_cylinder, the robot is not holding it.
Cannot push brown_3D_cylinder
Cannot pick beige_1D_line
Cannot place beige_1D_line, the robot is not holding it.
Cannot pick green_3D_cylinder
Cannot place green_3D_cylinder, the robot is not holding it.
All task planning is done


Here are constraints you should refer.
rules: {'1': 'Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. ', '2': 'Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. ', '3': 'If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. ', '4': 'If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. ', '5': 'Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. '}

Your task is to identify any errors in the preconditions and effects of the action within the given Action class.
!!! One notable thing is that, in many cases, these actions may be error-free. 
Therefore, if no errors are detected, simply return it as is.

Please answer with the template below:
---template start---
First, analyze the error message.
1.
2.
3.

Second, check the error part follows the notes
!!Note1. Do not assume the physical properties of the object.
!!Note2. If a predicate required by the constraints is not defined in the class Object, ignore the constraints please. 
# For example, treating a rigid object as a compressible object. They are different.
# For example, treating a bendable object as a foldable object. They are different.

Third, find the error part of the class Action
# Example
# def place() part is wrong. In our objects set, there is no compressible object. 
# However, the precondtion in 'def place()' violates the Note2 because they make precondtions ~~~

---template end---


A: 
---template start---

First, analyze the error message.
1. The error message indicates that the robot is unable to place objects because they are already considered "in the bin" after being picked.
2. The robot cannot push objects because they are not being held or are already considered "in the bin."
3. The robot cannot pick certain objects because they are already marked as "in the bin."

Second, check the error part follows the notes
!!Note1. Do not assume the physical properties of the object.
!!Note2. If a predicate required by the constraints is not defined in the class Object, ignore the constraints please. 
# The constraints mention plastic objects, but there is no predicate for plasticity in the Object class, so this should be ignored.

Third, find the error part of the class Action
# The error lies in the `pick` method of the `Action` class. The method sets `obj.in_bin = True` immediately after picking, which is incorrect. The object should only be marked as "in the bin" after it is placed in the box.
# The `place` method also has a logical error. It checks if the object is not already in the bin before placing it, which contradicts the `pick` method's effect of setting `in_bin` to True.
# To fix these issues, the `pick` method should not modify `obj.in_bin`, and the `place` method should set `obj.in_bin = True` after placing the object.

Corrected `pick` and `place` methods:

```python
def pick(self, obj, box):
    # Preconditions: The object must not be in the bin, and the robot hand must be empty.
    if not obj.in_bin and self.robot_handempty:
        print(f"pick {obj.name}")
        # Effects: The robot is now holding the object.
        self.state_holding(obj)
    else:
        print(f"Cannot pick {obj.name}")

def place(self, obj, box):
    # Action Description: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object.
    
    # Check if the robot is currently holding the object
    if self.robot_now_holding == obj:
        # Place the object in the box
        print(f"place {obj.name}")
        
        # Update the state to reflect the object is now in the bin
        obj.in_bin = True
        
        # Update the robot's state to hand empty after placing the object
        self.state_handempty()
    else:
        print(f"Cannot place {obj.name}, the robot is not holding it.")
```

---template end---

Q: Now you have to revise precondtions and effect of actions based on class Object and given predicates. 

class Action:
    def __init__(self, name: str = "UR5"):
        self.name = name    
        self.robot_handempty = True

        self.robot_now_holding = False

    # basic state
    def state_holding(self, obj):
        self.robot_handempty = False
        self.robot_now_holding = obj

    def pick(self, obj, box):
        # Preconditions: The object must not be in the bin, and the robot hand must be empty.
        if not obj.in_bin and self.robot_handempty:
            print(f"pick {obj.name}")
            # Effects: The robot is now holding the object, and the object is considered in the bin.
            self.state_holding(obj)
            obj.in_bin = True
        else:
            print(f"Cannot pick {obj.name}")

    def place(self, obj, box):
        # Action Description: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object.
        
        # Check if the robot is currently holding the object
        if self.robot_now_holding == obj:
            # Check if the object is not already in the bin
            if not obj.in_bin:
                # Since the constraint mentions a "plastic" object, and this property is not defined in the Object class,
                # we will ignore the constraint as instructed.
                
                # Place the object in the box
                print(f"place {obj.name}")
                
                # Update the state to reflect the object is now in the bin
                obj.in_bin = True
                
                # Update the robot's state to hand empty after placing the object
                self.state_handempty()
            else:
                print(f"Cannot place {obj.name}, it is already in the bin.")
        else:
            print(f"Cannot place {obj.name}, the robot is not holding it.")

    def bend(self, obj, box):
        print('Cannot bend')

    def push(self, obj, box):
        # Action Description: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. 
        # Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing.
        if self.robot_handempty and obj.is_3D and obj.is_compressible:
            print(f"push {obj.name}")
            # Effects: The robot hand remains empty after the action
            self.state_handempty()
        else:
            print(f"Cannot push {obj.name}")

    def fold(self, obj, box):
        print('Cannot fold')

    def dummy(self):
        pass
Additionally, you must satisfy the following constraints.
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 
Please revise pre-conditions and effect of the action

Fully understand the actions in the Action class and the initial states of all objects. Then tell me your understanding in 300 words.

A: 
The provided code defines a simple simulation of a robotic system tasked with manipulating objects into a bin, using a set of predefined actions encapsulated in the `Action` class. The `Object` class represents the objects to be manipulated, each with attributes such as color, shape, type, and physical properties like rigidity and compressibility. The `Box` class, although defined, is not fully utilized in the actions, serving primarily as a placeholder for potential future extensions.

The `Action` class models a robotic arm with a limited set of actions: `pick`, `place`, `push`, `bend`, `fold`, and `dummy`. The robot's state is tracked using two boolean attributes: `robot_handempty` and `robot_now_holding`. The `pick` action allows the robot to grasp an object, provided the object is not already in the bin and the robot's hand is empty. The `place` action deposits the object into a bin, contingent on the robot currently holding the object. The `push` action is specialized for 3D compressible objects, allowing the robot to push them downward into the bin without holding them, maintaining an empty hand state before and after the action.

The initial state of the objects is defined, with all objects starting outside the bin (`in_bin=False`). The objects vary in their physical properties, such as being rigid or compressible, and whether they are 3D. These properties influence the applicability of certain actions, particularly the `push` action, which requires the object to be both 3D and compressible.

The goal state requires all objects to be packed into the bin (`Packed=True`). Achieving this involves using the `pick` and `place` actions to move each object into the bin. The `push` action offers an alternative for specific objects, enhancing flexibility in achieving the goal. The constraints and properties of each object dictate the sequence and choice of actions, emphasizing the need for strategic planning in the manipulation process.

Q: Before start, you must follow the rules: 
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 

Also, we remind you the robot actions: 
pick: Pick an object that not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object. 
place: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object. 
bend: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action. 
push: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing. 
fold: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding. 

        
Please answer with the template below:
---template start---

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    <Example>
    # the object1.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # the object2.is_foldable is True, actions pick, place, fold are applicable
    # the object3.is_compressible is True, actions pick, place, push are applicable
    # ...
    
    <Example>
    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: False 
    # object3: in_bin: True
    # ...

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # !!Note1: Common Mistakes! pick -> fold -> place (x), fold -> pick -> place (o) 
    # !!Note2: Do not assume or change the physical properties of the object.
    # Write here.


    # Third, make an action sequence.
    # a) Initialize the robot and the box
    action = Action() 
    box = Box(...)

    # b) Action sequence
    

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    ...

    # Finally, add this code    
    print("All task planning is done")
