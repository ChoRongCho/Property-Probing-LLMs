# Object Initial State
object0 = Object(index=0, name='yellow_3D_cuboid', color='yellow', shape='3D_cuboid', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=False, is_compressible=True, is_3D=True)
object1 = Object(index=1, name='white_3D_cylinder', color='white', shape='3D_cylinder', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=False, is_compressible=True, is_3D=True)
object2 = Object(index=2, name='beige_1D_line', color='beige', shape='1D_line', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=True, is_compressible=False, is_3D=False)
object3 = Object(index=3, name='brown_3D_cylinder', color='brown', shape='3D_cylinder', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=False, is_compressible=True, is_3D=True)
object4 = Object(index=4, name='green_3D_cylinder', color='green', shape='3D_cylinder', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=True, is_compressible=False, is_3D=True)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    # object0.is_compressible is True, actions pick, place, push are applicable
    # object1.is_compressible is True, actions pick, place, push are applicable
    # object2.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object3.is_compressible is True, actions pick, place, push are applicable
    # object4.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable

    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object0: in_bin: True
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: True
    # object3: in_bin: True
    # object4: in_bin: True

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # 1. Pick and place a compressible object first (object0, object1, or object3).
    # 2. Push the compressible object after placing it.
    # 3. Pick and place the non-plastic, rigid object (object2).
    # 4. Pick and place the remaining compressible objects and push them.
    # 5. Finally, place the rigid object (object4).

    # Third, make an action sequence.
    # a) Initialize the robot and the box
    action = Action()
    box = Box(index=0, name='bin', object_type='box', in_bin_objects=[])

    # b) Action sequence
    action.pick(object0, box)
    action.place(object0, box)
    action.push(object0, box)

    action.pick(object2, box)
    action.place(object2, box)

    action.pick(object1, box)
    action.place(object1, box)
    action.push(object1, box)

    action.pick(object3, box)
    action.place(object3, box)
    action.push(object3, box)

    action.pick(object4, box)
    action.place(object4, box)

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    # The sequence starts by placing a compressible object (object0) to satisfy the rule that a compressible object must be in the box before placing a plastic object. 
    # After placing each compressible object, it is pushed to ensure it is properly packed. 
    # Non-plastic, rigid objects (object2) are placed without constraints. 
    # The sequence ensures all objects are packed according to the rules and goal states.

    # Finally, add this code    
    print("All task planning is done")

 
This code consists of four parts below.
1. Object Class (Start with [@dataclass])
2. Action Class (Start with [class Action:])
3. Object initial State (Start with [# Object Initial State])
4. Planning State (Start with [if __name__ == "__main__":])

And this is a planning result of the code.
Cannot pick yellow_3D_cuboid
place yellow_3D_cuboid
push yellow_3D_cuboid
pick beige_1D_line
Cannot place beige_1D_line
Cannot pick white_3D_cylinder
Cannot place white_3D_cylinder
Cannot push white_3D_cylinder
Cannot pick brown_3D_cylinder
Cannot place brown_3D_cylinder
Cannot push brown_3D_cylinder
Cannot pick green_3D_cylinder
Cannot place green_3D_cylinder
All task planning is done


Here are constraints you should refer.
rules: {'1': 'Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. ', '2': 'Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. ', '3': 'If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. ', '4': 'If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. ', '5': 'Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. '}

Your task is to identify any errors in the preconditions and effects of the action within the given Action class.
!!! One notable thing is that, in many cases, these actions may be error-free. 
Therefore, if no errors are detected, simply return it as is.

Please answer with the template below:
---template start---
First, analyze the error message.
1.
2.
3.

Second, check the error part follows the notes
!!Note1. Do not assume the physical properties of the object.
!!Note2. If a predicate required by the constraints is not defined in the class Object, ignore the constraints please. 
# For example, treating a rigid object as a compressible object. They are different.
# For example, treating a bendable object as a foldable object. They are different.

Third, find the error part of the class Action
# Example
# def place() part is wrong. In our objects set, there is no compressible object. 
# However, the precondtion in 'def place()' violates the Note2 because they make precondtions ~~~

---template end---


A: 
---template start---

First, analyze the error message.
1. The message "Cannot pick yellow_3D_cuboid" indicates that the preconditions for picking this object are not met.
2. The message "Cannot place beige_1D_line" suggests that the preconditions for placing this object are not satisfied.
3. The messages "Cannot pick", "Cannot place", and "Cannot push" for other objects indicate similar issues with unmet preconditions.

Second, check the error part follows the notes
!!Note1. Do not assume the physical properties of the object.
!!Note2. If a predicate required by the constraints is not defined in the class Object, ignore the constraints please. 
# For example, treating a rigid object as a compressible object. They are different.
# For example, treating a bendable object as a foldable object. They are different.

Third, find the error part of the class Action
# The error lies in the `pick` and `place` methods of the `Action` class.
# In the `pick` method, the precondition checks if the object is rigid, but object0 is not rigid, hence it cannot be picked.
# In the `place` method, the precondition checks if the robot's hand is empty, which is incorrect because the robot should be holding the object to place it.
# The `place` method should check if `self.robot_now_holding` is the object being placed and not if `self.robot_handempty` is True.

To fix these issues:
1. Modify the `pick` method to allow picking compressible objects if they are not rigid.
2. Correct the `place` method to check if the robot is holding the object before placing it.

Here is the corrected part of the `Action` class:

```python
def pick(self, obj, box):
    # Preconditions: The object is not in the bin, the robot hand is empty, and the object is either rigid or compressible.
    if not obj.in_bin and self.robot_handempty and (obj.is_rigid or obj.is_compressible):
        print(f"pick {obj.name}")
        # Effects: The robot is now holding the object, and the hand is no longer empty.
        self.state_holding(obj)
    else:
        print(f"Cannot pick {obj.name}")

def place(self, obj, box):
    # Preconditions: The robot must be holding the object, and the object should not already be in the bin.
    if self.robot_now_holding == obj and not obj.in_bin:
        print(f"place {obj.name}")
        # Effects: The object is now in the bin, and the robot's hand is empty.
        obj.in_bin = True
        self.state_handempty()
    else:
        print(f"Cannot place {obj.name}")
```

---template end---
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Now you have to revise precondtions and effect of actions based on class Object and given predicates. 

class Action:
    def __init__(self, name: str = "UR5"):
        self.name = name    
        self.robot_handempty = True
        self.robot_now_holding = False

    # basic state
    def state_handempty(self):
        self.robot_handempty = True
        self.robot_now_holding = False

    # basic state
    def state_holding(self, obj):
        self.robot_handempty = False
        self.robot_now_holding = obj

    def pick(self, obj, box):
        # Preconditions: The object is not in the bin, the robot hand is empty, and the object is rigid.
        if not obj.in_bin and self.robot_handempty and obj.is_rigid:
            print(f"pick {obj.name}")
            # Effects: The robot is now holding the object, and the hand is no longer empty.
            self.state_holding(obj)
        else:
            print(f"Cannot pick {obj.name}")

    def place(self, obj, box):
        # Action Description: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object.
        # Note: Since the constraint mentions "plastic" which is not a property in the Object class, it is ignored.
        
        if self.robot_handempty and not obj.in_bin:
            # Preconditions: The robot's hand must be empty and the object should not already be in the bin.
            
            print(f"place {obj.name}")
            # Effects: The object is now in the bin, and the robot's hand is empty.
            obj.in_bin = True
            self.state_handempty()
            
        else:
            print(f"Cannot place {obj.name}")

    def bend(self, obj, box):
        print('Cannot bend')

    def push(self, obj, box):
        # Action Description: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing.
        # Note! If a predicate required by the constraints is absent from the class Object, do not consider the constraints.
        if self.robot_handempty and obj.is_3D and obj.is_compressible and obj.in_bin:
            print(f"push {obj.name}")
            # Since the action requires the hand to be empty before and after, we ensure the state remains handempty
            self.state_handempty()
        else:
            print(f"Cannot push {obj.name}")

    def fold(self, obj, box):
        print('Cannot fold')

    def dummy(self):
        pass
Additionally, you must satisfy the following constraints.
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 
Please revise pre-conditions and effect of the action

Fully understand the actions in the Action class and the initial states of all objects. Then tell me your understanding in 300 words.

A: 
The provided code defines a system for simulating actions on objects in a bin-packing scenario using a robotic arm. The `Object` class represents various objects with attributes such as color, shape, and physical properties like rigidity and compressibility. Each object also has a boolean `in_bin` attribute indicating whether it is packed in a bin. The `Box` class is a placeholder for bins, holding a list of objects it contains.

The `Action` class models the robot's capabilities, focusing on manipulating objects. It includes methods for picking, placing, pushing, bending, and folding objects. The robot starts with an empty hand and can transition between holding an object and having an empty hand. The `pick` method allows the robot to grasp an object if it is not already in a bin, the robot's hand is empty, and the object is either rigid or compressible. The `place` method places an object into a bin if the robot is holding it and it is not already packed. The `push` method is specific to 3D compressible objects already in a bin, allowing the robot to push them further without holding them. The `bend` and `fold` methods are placeholders that currently do not perform any actions.

The initial state of the objects is defined with various properties, such as the `yellow_3D_cuboid` being compressible and 3D, while the `beige_1D_line` is rigid and not 3D. The goal state requires all objects to be packed in the bin, indicated by their `in_bin` attribute being `True`.

The system is designed to simulate a sequence of actions to achieve the goal state, ensuring all objects are packed. The constraints and preconditions for each action ensure that the robot operates within realistic physical limitations, such as only picking objects when the hand is empty and only pushing objects that are 3D and compressible.

Q: Before start, you must follow the rules: 
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 

Also, we remind you the robot actions: 
pick: Pick an object that not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object. 
place: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object. 
bend: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action. 
push: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing. 
fold: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding. 

        
Please answer with the template below:
---template start---

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    <Example>
    # the object1.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # the object2.is_foldable is True, actions pick, place, fold are applicable
    # the object3.is_compressible is True, actions pick, place, push are applicable
    # ...
    
    <Example>
    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: False 
    # object3: in_bin: True
    # ...

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # !!Note1: Common Mistakes! pick -> fold -> place (x), fold -> pick -> place (o) 
    # !!Note2: Do not assume or change the physical properties of the object.
    # Write here.


    # Third, make an action sequence.
    # a) Initialize the robot and the box
    action = Action() 
    box = Box(...)

    # b) Action sequence
    

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    ...

    # Finally, add this code    
    print("All task planning is done")

A: 
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    # the object0.is_compressible is True, actions pick, place, push are applicable
    # the object1.is_compressible is True, actions pick, place, push are applicable
    # the object2.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # the object3.is_compressible is True, actions pick, place, push are applicable
    # the object4.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable

    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object0: in_bin: True
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: True
    # object3: in_bin: True
    # object4: in_bin: True

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # 1. Pick and place all compressible objects first, then push them.
    # 2. Pick and place non-compressible objects.

    # Third, make an action sequence.
    # a) Initialize the robot and the box
    action = Action()
    box = Box(index=0, name='bin', object_type='box', in_bin_objects=[])

    # b) Action sequence
    # Pick and place compressible objects first
    action.pick(object0, box)
    action.place(object0, box)
    action.push(object0, box)

    action.pick(object1, box)
    action.place(object1, box)
    action.push(object1, box)

    action.pick(object3, box)
    action.place(object3, box)
    action.push(object3, box)

    # Pick and place non-compressible objects
    action.pick(object2, box)
    action.place(object2, box)

    action.pick(object4, box)
    action.place(object4, box)

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    # The sequence follows the rules by placing compressible objects first and pushing them afterward.
    # Non-compressible objects are placed without additional actions since they are not bendable or foldable.
    # The sequence ensures that all objects reach their goal state of being in the bin.

    # Finally, add this code    
    print("All task planning is done")
