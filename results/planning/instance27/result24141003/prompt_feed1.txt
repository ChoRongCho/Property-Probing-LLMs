# Object Initial State
object0 = Object(index=0, name='yellow_3D_cuboid', color='yellow', shape='3D_cuboid', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=False, is_compressible=True, is_3D=True)
object1 = Object(index=1, name='white_3D_cylinder', color='white', shape='3D_cylinder', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=False, is_compressible=True, is_3D=True)
object2 = Object(index=2, name='beige_1D_line', color='beige', shape='1D_line', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=True, is_compressible=False, is_3D=False)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    # object0.is_compressible is True, actions pick, place, push are applicable
    # object1.is_compressible is True, actions pick, place, push are applicable
    # object2.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object3.is_compressible is True, actions pick, place, push are applicable
    # object4.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable

    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object0: in_bin: True
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: True
    # object3: in_bin: True
    # object4: in_bin: True

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # 1. Pick and place all compressible objects first, then push them.
    # 2. Pick and place non-compressible objects.
    # 3. Ensure that a compressible object is in the bin before placing any plastic object.

    # Third, make an action sequence.
    # a) Initialize the robot and the box
    action = Action()
    box = Box(index=0, name='bin', object_type='box', in_bin_objects=[])

    # b) Action sequence
    # Pick and place compressible objects first
    action.pick(object0, box)
    action.place(object0, box)
    action.push(object0, box)

    action.pick(object1, box)
    action.place(object1, box)
    action.push(object1, box)

    action.pick(object3, box)
    action.place(object3, box)
    action.push(object3, box)

    # Place non-compressible objects
    action.pick(object2, box)
    action.place(object2, box)

    action.pick(object4, box)
    action.place(object4, box)

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    # The sequence starts by handling all compressible objects first, ensuring they are placed and pushed into the bin.
    # This satisfies the rule that a compressible object must be in the bin before placing any plastic objects.
    # Non-compressible objects are placed afterward without additional constraints.
    # The sequence respects all given rules and ensures all objects reach their goal states.

    # Finally, add this code    
    print("All task planning is done")

 
This code consists of four parts below.
1. Object Class (Start with [@dataclass])
2. Action Class (Start with [class Action:])
3. Object initial State (Start with [# Object Initial State])
4. Planning State (Start with [if __name__ == "__main__":])

And this is a planning result of the code.
pick yellow_3D_cuboid
Cannot place yellow_3D_cuboid
Cannot push yellow_3D_cuboid
Cannot pick white_3D_cylinder
Cannot place white_3D_cylinder
Cannot push white_3D_cylinder
Cannot pick brown_3D_cylinder
Cannot place brown_3D_cylinder
Cannot push brown_3D_cylinder
Cannot pick beige_1D_line
Cannot place beige_1D_line
Cannot pick green_3D_cylinder
Cannot place green_3D_cylinder
All task planning is done


Here are constraints you should refer.
rules: {'1': 'Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. ', '2': 'Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. ', '3': 'If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. ', '4': 'If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. ', '5': 'Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. '}

Your task is to identify any errors in the preconditions and effects of the action within the given Action class.
!!! One notable thing is that, in many cases, these actions may be error-free. 
Therefore, if no errors are detected, simply return it as is.

Please answer with the template below:
---template start---
First, analyze the error message.
1.
2.
3.

Second, check the error part follows the notes
!!Note1. Do not assume the physical properties of the object.
!!Note2. If a predicate required by the constraints is not defined in the class Object, ignore the constraints please. 
# For example, treating a rigid object as a compressible object. They are different.
# For example, treating a bendable object as a foldable object. They are different.

Third, find the error part of the class Action
# Example
# def place() part is wrong. In our objects set, there is no compressible object. 
# However, the precondtion in 'def place()' violates the Note2 because they make precondtions ~~~

---template end---


A: 
---template start---

First, analyze the error message.
1. The error message indicates that the robot is unable to place or push objects after picking them.
2. The message "Cannot place" and "Cannot push" suggests that the preconditions for these actions are not being met.
3. The sequence of actions is not achieving the desired goal states for the objects.

Second, check the error part follows the notes
!!Note1. Do not assume the physical properties of the object.
!!Note2. If a predicate required by the constraints is not defined in the class Object, ignore the constraints please. 
# For example, treating a rigid object as a compressible object. They are different.
# For example, treating a bendable object as a foldable object. They are different.

Third, find the error part of the class Action
# The error lies in the `place` method of the `Action` class.
# The precondition in the `place` method checks if the object is not already in a bin, which contradicts the logic of the `pick` method that sets `obj.in_bin = True` when an object is picked.
# This results in the inability to place the object because the condition `not obj.in_bin` is never satisfied after picking.
# To fix this, the `place` method should not check `not obj.in_bin` since the object is already marked as in the bin after picking.
# The corrected `place` method should only check if the robot is holding the object.

Corrected `place` method:
```python
def place(self, obj, box):
    # Action Description: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object.
    
    # Check if the robot is holding the object
    if self.robot_now_holding == obj:
        # Check if the object is of type 'obj' and if the constraint applies
        if obj.object_type == 'obj':
            # Since the constraint mentions a 'plastic' property which is not in the Object class, ignore the constraint
            print(f"place {obj.name}")
            # Update the state to reflect the object is now in the bin
            obj.in_bin = True
            self.state_handempty()
        else:
            # If the object is of type 'box', place it without constraints
            print(f"place {obj.name}")
            # Update the state to reflect the object is now in the bin
            obj.in_bin = True
            self.state_handempty()
    else:
        print(f"Cannot place {obj.name}")
```

Q: Now you have to revise precondtions and effect of actions based on class Object and given predicates. 

class Action:
    def __init__(self, name: str = "UR5"):
        self.name = name    
        self.robot_handempty = True
        self.robot_now_holding = False

    # basic state
    def state_handempty(self):
        self.robot_handempty = True
        self.robot_now_holding = False

    # basic state
    def state_holding(self, obj):
        self.robot_handempty = False
        self.robot_now_holding = obj

    def pick(self, obj, box):
        # Preconditions: The robot's hand must be empty, and the object must not be in the box.
        if self.robot_handempty and not obj.in_bin:
            # Action Description: Pick an object that is not in the box.
            print(f"pick {obj.name}")
            # Effects: The robot is now holding the object, and the object is considered in the bin.
            self.state_holding(obj)
            obj.in_bin = True
        else:
            print(f"Cannot pick {obj.name}")

    def place(self, obj, box):
        # Action Description: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object.
        
        # Check if the robot is holding the object and the object is not already in a bin
        if self.robot_now_holding == obj and not obj.in_bin:
            # Check if the object is of type 'obj' and if the constraint applies
            if obj.object_type == 'obj':
                # Since the constraint mentions a 'plastic' property which is not in the Object class, ignore the constraint
                print(f"place {obj.name}")
                # Update the state to reflect the object is now in the bin
                obj.in_bin = True
                self.state_handempty()
            else:
                # If the object is of type 'box', place it without constraints
                print(f"place {obj.name}")
                # Update the state to reflect the object is now in the bin
                obj.in_bin = True
                self.state_handempty()
        else:
            print(f"Cannot place {obj.name}")

    def bend(self, obj, box):
        print('Cannot bend')

    def push(self, obj, box):
        # Preconditions: The object must be compressible and 3D, and the robot's hand must be empty.
        if obj.is_compressible and obj.is_3D and self.robot_handempty:
            # Action Description: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. 
            # Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing.
            print(f"push {obj.name}")
            # Effects: The object is now considered in the bin.
            obj.in_bin = True
            # The robot's hand remains empty after the action.
            self.state_handempty()
        else:
            print(f"Cannot push {obj.name}")

    def fold(self, obj, box):
        print('Cannot fold')

    def dummy(self):
        pass
Additionally, you must satisfy the following constraints.
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 
Please revise pre-conditions and effect of the action

And this is the table of goal states where all objects should reach. 
The Goal State

|-------|--------------------|--------|
|   0   | yellow_3D_cuboid   |  True  |
|   1   | white_3D_cylinder  |  True  |
|   2   | beige_1D_line      |  True  |
|   3   | brown_3D_cylinder  |  True  |
|   4   | green_3D_cylinder  |  True  |

Fully understand the actions in the Action class and the initial states of all objects. Then tell me your understanding in 300 words.

A: 
The provided code defines a simulation of a robotic system tasked with manipulating objects into a bin, focusing on a set of actions that the robot can perform. The `Object` class represents items with various attributes such as color, shape, type, and physical properties like rigidity and compressibility. The `Box` class is also defined but primarily serves as a container for objects.

The `Action` class encapsulates the robot's capabilities, emphasizing three primary actions: `pick`, `place`, and `push`. The robot can only pick an object if its hand is empty and the object is not already in the bin. Once picked, the robot holds the object, preventing further picks until the object is placed. The `place` action allows the robot to deposit an object into the bin, provided it is holding the object. The `push` action is unique in that it requires the object to be both compressible and 3D, and the robot's hand must be empty. This action simulates pushing an object into the bin without holding it.

The initial state of each object is defined with specific attributes, such as whether they are in the bin or their physical properties. For instance, `object0` is a yellow 3D cuboid that is compressible and not rigid, making it suitable for the `push` action. In contrast, `object4` is a green 3D cylinder that is rigid and not compressible, limiting its manipulation options.

The goal state table indicates that all objects must eventually be packed into the bin. The challenge lies in selecting the appropriate actions based on each object's properties and the robot's current state. The robot must strategically use its actions to transition all objects from their initial states to the goal states, ensuring each object is packed into the bin. The constraints and properties of each object dictate the sequence and type of actions required to achieve this goal.

Q: Before start, you must follow the rules: 
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 

Also, we remind you the robot actions: 
pick: Pick an object that not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object. 
place: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object. 
bend: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action. 
push: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing. 
fold: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding. 

        
Please answer with the template below:
---template start---

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    <Example>
    # the object1.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # the object2.is_foldable is True, actions pick, place, fold are applicable
    # the object3.is_compressible is True, actions pick, place, push are applicable
    # ...

    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: False 
    # object3: in_bin: True
    # ...

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # !!Note1: Common Mistakes! pick -> fold -> place (x), fold -> pick -> place (o) 
    # !!Note2: Do not assume or change the physical properties of the object.
    # Write here.


    # Third, make an action sequence.
    # a) Initialize the robot and the box
    action = Action() 
    box = Box(...)

    # b) Action sequence
    

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
