    # !!Note1: Common Mistakes! pick -> fold -> place (x), fold -> pick -> place (o) 
    # !!Note2: Do not assume or change the physical properties of the object.

    # The sequence follows the rules: fold and bend actions are performed before picking and placing.
    # Compressible objects are pushed after being placed in the box.
    # The sequence ensures that all objects are placed in the box according to their properties and constraints.
