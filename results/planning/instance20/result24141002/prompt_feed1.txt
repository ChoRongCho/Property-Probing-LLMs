# Object Initial State
object0 = Object(index=0, name='white_3D_cuboid', color='white', shape='3D_cuboid', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=True, is_compressible=False, is_3D=True)
object1 = Object(index=1, name='white_3D_cylinder', color='white', shape='3D_cylinder', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=False, is_compressible=True, is_3D=True)
object2 = Object(index=2, name='beige_1D_line', color='beige', shape='1D_line', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=True, is_compressible=False, is_3D=False)

object4 = Object(index=4, name='brown_3D_cylinder', color='brown', shape='3D_cylinder', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=False, is_compressible=True, is_3D=True)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    # object0: is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object1: is_compressible is True, actions pick, place, push are applicable
    # object2: is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object3: is_compressible is True, actions pick, place, push are applicable
    # object4: is_compressible is True, actions pick, place, push are applicable
    
    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object0: in_bin: True
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: True
    # object3: in_bin: True
    # object4: in_bin: True

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # 1. Pick and place object0 (non-compressible, non-plastic)
    # 2. Pick and place object1 (compressible, push after placing)
    # 3. Pick and place object3 (compressible, push after placing)
    # 4. Pick and place object4 (compressible, push after placing)
    # 5. Pick and place object2 (non-compressible, non-plastic)

    # Third, make an action sequence.
    # a) Initialize the robot and the box
    action = Action() 
    box = Box(index=0, name='box', object_type='box', in_bin_objects=[])

    # b) Action sequence
    action.pick(object0, box)
    action.place(object0, box)

    action.pick(object1, box)
    action.place(object1, box)
    action.push(object1, box)

    action.pick(object3, box)
    action.place(object3, box)
    action.push(object3, box)

    action.pick(object4, box)
    action.place(object4, box)
    action.push(object4, box)

    action.pick(object2, box)
    action.place(object2, box)

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    # The sequence follows the rules: non-plastic objects are placed without constraints, 
    # compressible objects are pushed after placing, and no bending or folding actions are needed 
    # as there are no bendable or foldable objects. The sequence ensures all objects are packed 
    # into the box as per the goal states.

    # Finally, add this code    
    print("All task planning is done")

 
This code consists of four parts below.
1. Object Class (Start with [@dataclass])
2. Action Class (Start with [class Action:])
3. Object initial State (Start with [# Object Initial State])
4. Planning State (Start with [if __name__ == "__main__":])

And this is a planning result of the code.
pick white_3D_cuboid
Cannot place white_3D_cuboid - hand not empty or object already in bin
Cannot pick white_3D_cylinder
Cannot place white_3D_cylinder - hand not empty or object already in bin
Cannot push white_3D_cylinder because the hand is not empty
Cannot pick red_3D_polyhedron
Cannot place red_3D_polyhedron - hand not empty or object already in bin
Cannot push red_3D_polyhedron because the hand is not empty
Cannot pick brown_3D_cylinder
Cannot place brown_3D_cylinder - hand not empty or object already in bin
Cannot push brown_3D_cylinder because the hand is not empty
Cannot pick beige_1D_line
Cannot place beige_1D_line - hand not empty or object already in bin
All task planning is done


Here are constraints you should refer.
rules: {'1': 'Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. ', '2': 'Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. ', '3': 'If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. ', '4': 'If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. ', '5': 'Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. '}

Your task is to identify any errors in the preconditions and effects of the action within the given Action class.
!!! One notable thing is that, in many cases, these actions may be error-free. 
Therefore, if no errors are detected, simply return it as is.

Please answer with the template below:
---template start---
First, analyze the error message.
1.
2.
3.

Second, check the error part follows the notes
!!Note1. Do not assume the physical properties of the object.
!!Note2. If a predicate required by the constraints is not defined in the class Object, ignore the constraints please. 
# For example, treating a rigid object as a compressible object. They are different.
# For example, treating a bendable object as a foldable object. They are different.

Third, find the error part of the class Action
# Example
# def place() part is wrong. In our objects set, there is no compressible object. 
# However, the precondtion in 'def place()' violates the Note2 because they make precondtions ~~~

---template end---


A: 
---template start---

First, analyze the error message.
1. The error message indicates that the robot cannot place objects because the hand is not empty or the object is already in the bin.
2. The robot cannot pick certain objects, which suggests that the preconditions for picking are not met.
3. The robot cannot push objects because the hand is not empty, which implies a logical error in the sequence of actions.

Second, check the error part follows the notes
!!Note1. Do not assume the physical properties of the object.
!!Note2. If a predicate required by the constraints is not defined in the class Object, ignore the constraints please. 
# For example, treating a rigid object as a compressible object. They are different.
# For example, treating a bendable object as a foldable object. They are different.

Third, find the error part of the class Action
# The error lies in the `place()` method of the `Action` class. The precondition checks are incorrect:
  - The condition `if self.robot_handempty and not obj.in_bin:` should be `if not self.robot_handempty and not obj.in_bin:` because the robot must be holding the object to place it.
  - The check for `hasattr(obj, 'material')` is unnecessary since the `Object` class does not define a `material` attribute. This should be removed or corrected to align with the actual attributes of the `Object` class.
  - The `place()` method should not check for compressible objects in the box before placing a non-plastic object, as per the constraints.
  - The `push()` method should ensure the hand is empty before pushing, which is correct, but the sequence of actions should ensure the hand is empty after placing an object.

Corrected `place()` method:
```python
def place(self, obj, box):
    # Check if the object is in the correct state to be placed
    if not self.robot_handempty and not obj.in_bin:
        # Place the object
        print(f"place {obj.name}")
        obj.in_bin = True
        box.in_bin_objects.append(obj)
        self.state_handempty()
    else:
        print(f"Cannot place {obj.name} - hand not empty or object already in bin")
```

---template end---

Q: Now you have to revise precondtions and effect of actions based on class Object and given predicates. 

class Action:
    def __init__(self, name: str = "UR5"):
        self.name = name    
        self.robot_handempty = True

        self.robot_now_holding = obj

    def pick(self, obj, box):
        # Preconditions: The robot's hand must be empty, and the object must not be in the box.
        if self.robot_handempty and not obj.in_bin:
            # Action Description: Pick an object that is not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object.
            print(f"pick {obj.name}")
            # Effect: The robot is now holding the object, and the hand is no longer empty.
            self.state_holding(obj)
        else:
            print(f"Cannot pick {obj.name}")

    def place(self, obj, box):
        # Check if the object is in the correct state to be placed
        if self.robot_handempty and not obj.in_bin:
            # Check if the constraints apply
            if hasattr(obj, 'material') and obj.material == 'plastic' and obj.is_compressible:
                # Check if there is already a compressible object in the box
                if any(o.is_compressible for o in box.in_bin_objects):
                    print(f"place {obj.name}")
                    # Update the state to reflect the object is now in the box
                    obj.in_bin = True
                    box.in_bin_objects.append(obj)
                    self.state_handempty()
                else:
                    print(f"Cannot place {obj.name} - no compressible object in the box")
            else:
                # If constraints do not apply, place the object
                print(f"place {obj.name}")
                obj.in_bin = True
                box.in_bin_objects.append(obj)
                self.state_handempty()
        else:
            print(f"Cannot place {obj.name} - hand not empty or object already in bin")

    def bend(self, obj, box):
        print('Cannot bend')

    def push(self, obj, box):
        # Check if the object is compressible and 3D
        if obj.is_compressible and obj.is_3D:
            # Action Description: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin.
            # Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing.
            if self.robot_handempty:
                print(f"push {obj.name}")
                # No change in hand state as the hand must remain empty
                self.state_handempty()
            else:
                print(f"Cannot push {obj.name} because the hand is not empty")
        else:
            print(f"Cannot push {obj.name} because it does not meet the compressible and 3D criteria")

    def fold(self, obj, box):
        print('Cannot fold')

    def dummy(self):
        pass
Additionally, you must satisfy the following constraints.
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 
Please revise pre-conditions and effect of the action

# Object Initial State
object0 = Object(index=0, name='white_3D_cuboid', color='white', shape='3D_cuboid', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=True, is_compressible=False, is_3D=True)
object1 = Object(index=1, name='white_3D_cylinder', color='white', shape='3D_cylinder', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=False, is_compressible=True, is_3D=True)
object2 = Object(index=2, name='beige_1D_line', color='beige', shape='1D_line', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=True, is_compressible=False, is_3D=False)
object3 = Object(index=3, name='red_3D_polyhedron', color='red', shape='3D_polyhedron', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=False, is_compressible=True, is_3D=True)
object4 = Object(index=4, name='brown_3D_cylinder', color='brown', shape='3D_cylinder', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=False, is_compressible=True, is_3D=True)

And this is the table of goal states where all objects should reach. 
The Goal State
| Index | Name              | Packed |
|-------|-------------------|--------|
|   0   | white_3D_cuboid   |  True  |
|   1   | white_3D_cylinder |  True  |
|   2   | beige_1D_line     |  True  |
|   3   | red_3D_polyhedron |  True  |
|   4   | brown_3D_cylinder |  True  |

Fully understand the actions in the Action class and the initial states of all objects. Then tell me your understanding in 300 words.

A: 
The provided code defines a simple simulation of a robotic system tasked with packing objects into a box. The system is modeled using Python classes, specifically leveraging the `dataclass` decorator for defining the `Object` and `Box` classes, which simplifies the creation of classes that are primarily used to store data.

The `Object` class represents items that can be manipulated by the robot. Each object has attributes such as `index`, `name`, `color`, `shape`, and `object_type`. Additionally, objects have physical state attributes like `in_bin` (indicating if the object is packed), `is_rigid`, `is_compressible`, and `is_3D`. These attributes determine how the object can be manipulated.

The `Box` class represents the container into which objects are packed. It has an `index`, `name`, and a list `in_bin_objects` to keep track of objects that have been packed.

The `Action` class encapsulates the robot's actions, with methods to simulate picking, placing, pushing, bending, and folding objects. The robot can only pick an object if its hand is empty and the object is not already in the bin. Placing an object requires the robot to be holding it, and if the object is plastic, a compressible object must already be in the box. The `push` action is allowed only for compressible and 3D objects when the robot's hand is empty. The `bend` and `fold` actions are not implemented, indicating these actions are not possible in this scenario.

The initial state of the objects is defined, with none of them packed in the box. The goal state requires all objects to be packed. The challenge lies in using the available actions to transition each object from its initial state to the goal state, considering the constraints imposed by the object's properties and the robot's current state.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Before start, you must follow the rules: 
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 

Also, we remind you the robot actions: 
pick: Pick an object that not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object. 
place: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object. 
bend: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action. 
push: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing. 
fold: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding. 

        
Please answer with the template below:
---template start---

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    <Example>
    # the object1.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # the object2.is_foldable is True, actions pick, place, fold are applicable
    # the object3.is_compressible is True, actions pick, place, push are applicable
    # ...
    
    <Example>
    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: False 
    # object3: in_bin: True
    # ...

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # !!Note1: Common Mistakes! pick -> fold -> place (x), fold -> pick -> place (o) 
    # !!Note2: Do not assume or change the physical properties of the object.
    # Write here.


    # Third, make an action sequence.
    # a) Initialize the robot and the box
    action = Action() 
    box = Box(...)

    # b) Action sequence
    

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
