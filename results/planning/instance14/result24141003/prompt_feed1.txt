# Object Initial State
object0 = Object(index=0, name='white_3D_cuboid', color='white', shape='3D_cuboid', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=True, is_compressible=False, is_plastic=False, is_packable=False)
object1 = Object(index=1, name='yellow_3D_cuboid', color='yellow', shape='3D_cuboid', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=False, is_compressible=True, is_plastic=False, is_packable=False)
object2 = Object(index=2, name='blue_3D_cylinder', color='blue', shape='3D_cylinder', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=True, is_compressible=False, is_plastic=False, is_packable=False)
object3 = Object(index=3, name='blue_2D_rectangle', color='blue', shape='2D_rectangle', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=False, is_compressible=False, is_plastic=True, is_packable=False)
object4 = Object(index=4, name='beige_1D_line', color='beige', shape='1D_line', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=True, is_compressible=False, is_plastic=False, is_packable=False)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    # object0: is_rigid=True, is_compressible=False, is_plastic=False, actions: pick, place
    # object1: is_rigid=False, is_compressible=True, is_plastic=False, actions: pick, place, push
    # object2: is_rigid=True, is_compressible=False, is_plastic=False, actions: pick, place
    # object3: is_rigid=False, is_compressible=False, is_plastic=True, actions: pick, place
    # object4: is_rigid=True, is_compressible=False, is_plastic=False, actions: pick, place

    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object0: in_bin: True
    # object1: in_bin: True 
    # object2: in_bin: True
    # object3: in_bin: True
    # object4: in_bin: True

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # 1. Pick and place object1 (compressible), then push it.
    # 2. Pick and place object0 (non-plastic).
    # 3. Pick and place object2 (non-plastic).
    # 4. Pick and place object4 (non-plastic).
    # 5. Pick and place object3 (plastic, after object1 is in the box).

    # Third, make an action sequence.
    # a) Initialize the robot and the box
    action = Action()
    box = Box(index=0, name='box', object_type='box', in_bin_objects=[])

    # b) Action sequence
    action.pick(object1, box)
    action.place(object1, box)
    action.push(object1, box)

    action.pick(object0, box)
    action.place(object0, box)

    action.pick(object2, box)
    action.place(object2, box)

    action.pick(object4, box)
    action.place(object4, box)

    action.pick(object3, box)
    action.place(object3, box)

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    # The sequence follows the rules: object1 is placed and pushed first to allow object3 (plastic) to be placed later.
    # Non-plastic objects (object0, object2, object4) are placed without constraints.
    # The sequence ensures that all objects are packed according to their properties and the rules provided.

    # Finally, add this code    
    print("All task planning is done")

 
This code consists of four parts below.
1. Object Class (Start with [@dataclass])
2. Action Class (Start with [class Action:])
3. Object initial State (Start with [# Object Initial State])
4. Planning State (Start with [if __name__ == "__main__":])

And this is a planning result of the code.
Cannot pick yellow_3D_cuboid
Cannot place yellow_3D_cuboid - object is not packable
push yellow_3D_cuboid
Cannot pick white_3D_cuboid
Cannot place white_3D_cuboid - object is not packable
Cannot pick blue_3D_cylinder
Cannot place blue_3D_cylinder - object is not packable
Cannot pick beige_1D_line
Cannot place beige_1D_line - object is not packable
Cannot pick blue_2D_rectangle
Cannot place blue_2D_rectangle - object is not packable
All task planning is done


Here are constraints you should refer.
rules: {'1': 'Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. ', '2': 'Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. ', '3': 'If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. ', '4': 'If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. ', '5': 'Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. '}

Your task is to identify any errors in the preconditions and effects of the action within the given Action class.
!!! One notable thing is that, in many cases, these actions may be error-free. 
Therefore, if no errors are detected, simply return it as is.

Please answer with the template below:
---template start---
First, analyze the error message.
1.
2.
3.

Second, check the error part follows the notes
!!Note1. Do not assume the physical properties of the object.
!!Note2. If a predicate required by the constraints is not defined in the class Object, ignore the constraints please. 
# For example, treating a rigid object as a compressible object. They are different.
# For example, treating a bendable object as a foldable object. They are different.

Third, find the error part of the class Action
# Example
# def place() part is wrong. In our objects set, there is no compressible object. 
# However, the precondtion in 'def place()' violates the Note2 because they make precondtions ~~~

---template end---


A: 
---template start---

First, analyze the error message.
1. The error message indicates that none of the objects can be picked or placed because they are not packable.
2. The action sequence attempts to pick and place objects that are not marked as packable.
3. The push action is executed successfully for `object1`, but the pick and place actions fail for all objects.

Second, check the error part follows the notes
!!Note1. Do not assume the physical properties of the object.
!!Note2. If a predicate required by the constraints is not defined in the class Object, ignore the constraints please. 
# For example, treating a rigid object as a compressible object. They are different.
# For example, treating a bendable object as a foldable object. They are different.

Third, find the error part of the class Action
# The error lies in the preconditions for the `pick` and `place` methods in the `Action` class.
# The `pick` method checks if an object is packable before allowing it to be picked. However, all objects in the initial state are marked as not packable (`is_packable=False`).
# The `place` method also checks if an object is packable before allowing it to be placed. This condition prevents any object from being placed.
# To fix this, the initial state of the objects should be updated to set `is_packable=True` for objects that are intended to be picked and placed according to the planning sequence.

Q: Now you have to revise precondtions and effect of actions based on class Object and given predicates. 

class Action:
    def __init__(self, name: str = "UR5"):
        self.name = name

    def pick(self, obj, box):
        # Preconditions: The object must not be in the bin, the robot hand must be empty, and the object must be packable.
        if not obj.in_bin and self.robot_handempty and obj.is_packable:
            print(f"pick {obj.name}")
            # Effects: The robot is now holding the object, and the object is considered in the bin.
            self.state_holding(obj)
            obj.in_bin = True
        else:
            print(f"Cannot pick {obj.name}")

    def place(self, obj, box):
        # Action Description: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object.
        # Note: If a predicate required by the constraints is absent from the class Object, do not consider the constraints.
        
        # Check if the object is packable
        if obj.is_packable:
            # Check if the object is plastic and if the constraint applies
            if obj.is_plastic:
                # Ensure there's at least one compressible object already in the box
                if any(o.is_compressible for o in box.in_bin_objects):
                    print(f"place {obj.name}")
                    # Update the state to reflect the object is now in the box
                    obj.in_bin = True
                    box.in_bin_objects.append(obj)
                    self.state_handempty()
                else:
                    print(f"Cannot place {obj.name} - requires a compressible object in the box first")
            else:
                # Non-plastic objects can be placed without constraints
                print(f"place {obj.name}")
                # Update the state to reflect the object is now in the box
                obj.in_bin = True
                box.in_bin_objects.append(obj)
                self.state_handempty()
        else:
            print(f"Cannot place {obj.name} - object is not packable")

    def bend(self, obj, box):
        print('Cannot bend')

    def push(self, obj, box):
        # Check if the object is compressible and the robot's hand is empty
        if obj.is_compressible and self.robot_handempty:
            # Action Description: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin.
            print(f"push {obj.name}")
            # Ensure the robot's hand remains empty after the action
            self.state_handempty()
        else:
            print(f"Cannot push {obj.name}")

    def fold(self, obj, box):
        print('Cannot fold')

    def dummy(self):
        pass
Additionally, you must satisfy the following constraints.
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 
Please revise pre-conditions and effect of the action

            # Action Description: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin.
            print(f"push {obj.name}")
            # Ensure the robot's hand remains empty after the action
            self.state_handempty()
        else:

# Object Initial State
object0 = Object(index=0, name='white_3D_cuboid', color='white', shape='3D_cuboid', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=True, is_compressible=False, is_plastic=False, is_packable=False)
object1 = Object(index=1, name='yellow_3D_cuboid', color='yellow', shape='3D_cuboid', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=False, is_compressible=True, is_plastic=False, is_packable=False)
object2 = Object(index=2, name='blue_3D_cylinder', color='blue', shape='3D_cylinder', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=True, is_compressible=False, is_plastic=False, is_packable=False)
object3 = Object(index=3, name='blue_2D_rectangle', color='blue', shape='2D_rectangle', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=False, is_compressible=False, is_plastic=True, is_packable=False)

And this is the table of goal states where all objects should reach. 
The Goal State
| Index | Name             | Packed |
|-------|------------------|--------|
|   0   | white_3D_cuboid  |  True  |
|   1   | yellow_3D_cuboid |  True  |
|   2   | blue_3D_cylinder |  True  |
|   3   | blue_2D_rectangle|  True  |
|   4   | beige_1D_line    |  True  |

Fully understand the actions in the Action class and the initial states of all objects. Then tell me your understanding in 300 words.

A: 
The provided code defines a system for simulating actions on objects and boxes, specifically focusing on a bin-packing scenario. The `Object` class represents individual items with various attributes such as color, shape, and physical properties like rigidity, compressibility, and plasticity. Each object also has a boolean `in_bin` attribute indicating whether it is currently packed in a box.

The `Box` class represents containers that can hold objects, with a list to track which objects are inside. The `Action` class encapsulates the robot's capabilities to manipulate these objects, with methods for picking, placing, pushing, and other actions.

The `pick` method allows the robot to pick up an object if the robot's hand is empty and the object is not already in a bin. The `place` method places an object into a box, with specific constraints for plastic objects, which require at least one compressible object already in the box. This constraint simulates a real-world scenario where certain materials might need cushioning or specific conditions to be packed safely.

The `push` method is designed for compressible objects, allowing them to be pushed into a bin without the robot holding them. This reflects a scenario where compressible objects can be adjusted or packed without direct manipulation.

The initial state of the objects indicates that none are packed in a bin, and they have varying properties. For example, `object1` is compressible, while `object3` is plastic, influencing how they can be manipulated according to the defined actions.

The goal state table specifies that all objects should eventually be packed (`Packed: True`). The challenge lies in using the defined actions to transition each object from its initial state to the goal state, adhering to the constraints and properties outlined in the `Action` class. This setup provides a framework for testing and developing algorithms for automated packing, considering physical properties and constraints.

Q: Before start, you must follow the rules: 
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 

Also, we remind you the robot actions: 
pick: Pick an object that not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object. 
place: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object. 
bend: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action. 
push: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing. 
fold: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding. 

        
Please answer with the template below:
---template start---

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    <Example>
    # the object1.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # the object2.is_foldable is True, actions pick, place, fold are applicable
    # the object3.is_compressible is True, actions pick, place, push are applicable
    # ...
    
    <Example>
    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: False 
    # object3: in_bin: True
    # ...

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # !!Note1: Common Mistakes! pick -> fold -> place (x), fold -> pick -> place (o) 
    # !!Note2: Do not assume or change the physical properties of the object.
    # Write here.


    # Third, make an action sequence.
    # a) Initialize the robot and the box
    action = Action() 
    box = Box(...)

    # b) Action sequence
    

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.

    # object4: in_bin: True

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # 1. Pick and place object1 (compressible), then push it.
    # 2. Pick and place object0 (non-plastic, no constraints).
    # 3. Pick and place object2 (non-plastic, no constraints).
    # 4. Pick and place object3 (plastic, requires compressible object already placed).
    # 5. Pick and place object4 (non-plastic, no constraints).

    # Third, make an action sequence.

    action.pick(object0, box)
    action.place(object0, box)

    action.pick(object2, box)

    action.place(object4, box)

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    # The sequence ensures that the compressible object (object1) is placed first and pushed,
    # satisfying the requirement for placing the plastic object (object3) later.
    # Non-plastic objects (object0, object2, object4) are placed without constraints.
    # The sequence adheres to all rules and achieves the goal state for all objects.

    # Finally, add this code    
    print("All task planning is done")
