    # the object2.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # the object3.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # the object4.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable

    # object1: in_bin: True 
    # object2: in_bin: True
    # object3: in_bin: True
    # object4: in_bin: True

    # !!Note1: Common Mistakes! pick -> fold -> place (x), fold -> pick -> place (o) 
    # !!Note2: Do not assume or change the physical properties of the object.

    # All objects are rigid and non-plastic, so they can be picked and placed directly into the box without any additional constraints.
    # The sequence ensures that each object is picked and placed in the box, achieving the goal state where all objects are packed.
