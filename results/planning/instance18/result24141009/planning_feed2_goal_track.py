    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    # object0.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object1.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object2.is_plastic is True, actions pick, place are applicable (with constraints)
    # object3.is_plastic is True, actions pick, place are applicable (with constraints)

    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object0: in_bin: True
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: True
    # object3: in_bin: True

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # 1. Pick and place object0 (rigid, no constraints)
    # 2. Pick and place object1 (rigid, no constraints)
    # 3. Pick and place object2 (plastic, requires a compressible object in the box)
    # 4. Pick and place object3 (plastic, requires a compressible object in the box)

    # Third, make an action sequence.
    # a) Initialize the robot and the box
    action = Action()
    box = Box(index=0, name='box', object_type='box', in_bin_objects=[])

    # b) Action sequence
    action.pick(object0, box)
    action.place(object0, box)
    action.push(object0, box)  # Push because object0 is 3D and compressible

    action.pick(object1, box)
    action.place(object1, box)
    action.push(object1, box)  # Push because object1 is 3D and compressible

    action.pick(object2, box)
    action.place(object2, box)  # Can place because object0 or object1 is compressible

    action.pick(object3, box)
    action.place(object3, box)  # Can place because object0 or object1 is compressible

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    # The sequence ensures that all objects are placed in the box according to their constraints.
    # Rigid objects (object0 and object1) are placed first as they have no constraints.
    # Plastic objects (object2 and object3) are placed after ensuring there is a compressible object in the box.
    # The push action is applied to 3D objects after placing them to ensure they are properly packed.

    # Finally, add this code
