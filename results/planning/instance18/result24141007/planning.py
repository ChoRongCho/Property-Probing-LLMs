    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    # object0.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object1.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object2.is_plastic is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object3.is_plastic is True, actions pick, place are applicable

    # object0: in_bin: True
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: True
    # object3: in_bin: True

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # 1. Pick and place object0 (rigid, non-plastic) into the box.
    # 2. Pick and place object1 (rigid, non-plastic) into the box.
    # 3. Pick and place object2 (plastic) into the box after object0 or object1 is placed.
    # 4. Pick and place object3 (plastic) into the box after object0 or object1 is placed.

    # a) Initialize the robot and the box

    action.pick(object2, box)
    action.place(object2, box)

    action.pick(object3, box)
    action.place(object3, box)

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    # The sequence starts with placing non-plastic objects (object0 and object1) to ensure that the box contains compressible objects.
    # This satisfies the rule that a compressible object must be in the box before placing plastic objects.
    # Since object2 and object3 are plastic, they are placed after object0 or object1.
    # No bending, folding, or pushing actions are required as there are no bendable or foldable objects, and pushing is not applicable to plastic objects.
