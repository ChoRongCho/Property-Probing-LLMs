    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    # object0.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place, push are applicable
    # object1.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place, push are applicable
    # object2.is_plastic is True, actions pick, place are applicable (requires a compressible object in the box first)
    # object3.is_plastic is True, actions pick, place are applicable (requires a compressible object in the box first)

    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object0: in_bin: True
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: True
    # object3: in_bin: True

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # 1. Pick and place object0 (rigid, compressible)
    # 2. Push object0
    # 3. Pick and place object1 (rigid, compressible)
    # 4. Push object1
    # 5. Pick and place object2 (plastic, requires compressible object in the box)
    # 6. Pick and place object3 (plastic, requires compressible object in the box)

    # a) Initialize the robot and the box

    action.pick(object3, box)
    action.place(object3, box)

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    # The sequence starts by placing rigid objects (object0 and object1) first, as they are compressible and satisfy the condition for placing plastic objects later.
    # After placing each rigid object, a push action is performed to simulate compressing the object in the box.
    # Once the box contains compressible objects, plastic objects (object2 and object3) can be placed without violating the constraints.
    # The sequence ensures that all objects are placed in the box, achieving the goal state.

    # Finally, add this code
