if __name__ == "__main__":
    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    # object0.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object1.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object2.is_plastic is True, actions pick, place are applicable

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # 1. Pick object0, place it in the box.
    # 2. Pick object1, place it in the box.

    # The sequence follows the rules by first placing non-plastic objects (object0 and object1) without constraints.
    # Then, plastic objects (object2 and object3) are placed, as the constraint of having a compressible object in the box is satisfied.
    # The actions are executed in a sequence that respects the robot's capabilities and the constraints provided.

    # Finally, add this code

This code consists of four parts below.
1. Object Class (Start with [@dataclass])
2. Action Class (Start with [class Action:])
3. Object initial State (Start with [# Object Initial State])
4. Planning State (Start with [if __name__ == "__main__":])

And this is a planning result of the code.
pick white_3D_cuboid
place white_3D_cuboid
pick blue_3D_cylinder
place blue_3D_cylinder
pick blue_2D_rectangle
Cannot place blue_2D_rectangle
Cannot pick gray_1D_line
Cannot place gray_1D_line
All task planning is done


Here are constraints you should refer.
rules: {'1': 'Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. ', '2': 'Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. ', '3': 'If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. ', '4': 'If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. ', '5': 'Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. '}

Your task is to identify any errors in the preconditions and effects of the action within the given Action class.
!!! One notable thing is that, in many cases, these actions may be error-free. 
Therefore, if no errors are detected, simply return it as is.

Please answer with the template below:
---template start---
First, analyze the error message.
1.
2.
3.

Second, check the error part follows the notes
!!Note1. Do not assume the physical properties of the object.
!!Note2. If a predicate required by the constraints is not defined in the class Object, ignore the constraints please. 
# For example, treating a rigid object as a compressible object. They are different.
# For example, treating a bendable object as a foldable object. They are different.

Third, find the error part of the class Action
# Example
# def place() part is wrong. In our objects set, there is no compressible object. 
# However, the precondtion in 'def place()' violates the Note2 because they make precondtions ~~~

---template end---


A: 
---template start---

First, analyze the error message.
1. The action sequence fails to place `blue_2D_rectangle` because the precondition for placing a plastic object is not met.
2. The action sequence fails to pick `gray_1D_line` because it is not handled correctly in the code logic.
3. The action sequence fails to place `gray_1D_line` due to the same precondition issue as `blue_2D_rectangle`.

Second, check the error part follows the notes
!!Note1. Do not assume the physical properties of the object.
!!Note2. If a predicate required by the constraints is not defined in the class Object, ignore the constraints please. 
# For example, treating a rigid object as a compressible object. They are different.
# For example, treating a bendable object as a foldable object. They are different.

Third, find the error part of the class Action
# The `place()` method is incorrect. The code checks for a compressible object before placing a plastic object, but the definition of a compressible object is not clear. The code assumes non-rigid objects are compressible, which is not explicitly defined in the `Object` class.
# The `pick()` method does not handle the case where the object is already in the bin, which is why `gray_1D_line` cannot be picked.
# To fix these issues:
  - Clarify the definition of a compressible object in the `Object` class or adjust the logic in the `place()` method to align with the constraints.
  - Ensure the `pick()` method correctly handles objects that are not yet in the bin.

Q: Now you have to revise precondtions and effect of actions based on class Object and given predicates. 

class Action:
    def __init__(self, name: str = "UR5"):
        self.name = name    
        self.robot_handempty = True
        self.robot_now_holding = False

    # basic state
    def state_handempty(self):
        self.robot_handempty = True
        self.robot_now_holding = False

    # basic state
    def state_holding(self, obj):
        self.robot_handempty = False
        self.robot_now_holding = obj

    def pick(self, obj, box):
        # Preconditions: The object must not be in the bin, and the robot's hand must be empty.
        if not obj.in_bin and self.robot_handempty:
            # Action Description: Pick an object that is not in the box. 
            # The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object.
            print(f"pick {obj.name}")
            # Effect: The robot is now holding the object, and the hand is no longer empty.
            self.state_holding(obj)
        else:
            print(f"Cannot pick {obj.name}")

    def place(self, obj, box):
        # Action Description: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object.
        # Note! If a predicate required by the constraints is absent from the class Object, do not consider the constraints.
        
        # Check if the object is plastic and if the constraint applies
        if obj.is_plastic:
            # Check if there is a compressible object already in the box
            compressible_present = any(o.is_rigid == False for o in box.in_bin_objects)
            
            if not compressible_present:
                print(f"Cannot place {obj.name}")
                return

        # If constraints are not applicable or satisfied, proceed with placing the object
        print(f"place {obj.name}")
        box.in_bin_objects.append(obj)
        self.state_handempty()

    def bend(self, obj, box):
        print('Cannot bend')

    def push(self, obj, box):
        print('Cannot push')

    def fold(self, obj, box):
        print('Cannot fold')

    def dummy(self):
        pass
Additionally, you must satisfy the following constraints.
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 
Please revise pre-conditions and effect of the action

    def place(self, obj, box):
        # Action Description: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object.
        if obj.is_plastic:

            compressible_present = any(not o.is_rigid for o in box.in_bin_objects)
            
            if not compressible_present:

        print(f"place {obj.name}")
        box.in_bin_objects.append(obj)
        obj.in_bin = True  # Update the object's state to reflect it is now in the bin

    def dummy(self):
        pass

# Object Initial State
object0 = Object(index=0, name='white_3D_cuboid', color='white', shape='3D_cuboid', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=True, is_3D=True)
object1 = Object(index=1, name='blue_3D_cylinder', color='blue', shape='3D_cylinder', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=True, is_3D=True)

And this is the table of goal states where all objects should reach. 
The Goal State
| Index | Name             | Packed |
|-------|------------------|--------|
|   0   | white_3D_cuboid  |  True  |
|   1   | blue_3D_cylinder |  True  |
|   2   | blue_2D_rectangle|  True  |
|   3   | gray_1D_line     |  True  |

Fully understand the actions in the Action class and the initial states of all objects. Then tell me your understanding in 300 words.

A: 
The provided code defines a simple simulation for a bin-packing task using a robotic arm, represented by the `Action` class. The simulation involves objects and boxes, with the goal of placing all objects into a box. The `Object` class describes the properties of each object, including its index, name, color, shape, type, and whether it is currently in a bin. Additional properties indicate if the object is rigid, plastic, or 3D. The `Box` class holds a list of objects currently placed inside it.

The `Action` class simulates the robot's actions, with methods to pick and place objects. The robot can only pick an object if it is not already in a bin and if the robot's hand is empty. Once an object is picked, the robot's state changes to holding the object. The `place` method allows the robot to place an object into a box, with specific conditions for plastic objects. If a plastic object is to be placed, there must be a non-rigid object already in the box to accommodate it. This reflects a constraint where plastic objects require compressible space.

The initial state of the objects is defined, with none of them in a bin. The objects vary in their properties: some are rigid, some are plastic, and they have different shapes and dimensions. The goal state requires all objects to be packed into a box, meaning their `in_bin` attribute should be set to `True`.

The code's logic ensures that objects are picked and placed according to their properties and the robot's current state. The robot cannot perform actions like bending, pushing, or folding, which are not applicable in this context. The simulation emphasizes understanding object properties and constraints to achieve the goal state, demonstrating a basic approach to automated bin-packing tasks.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Before start, you must follow the rules: 
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 

Also, we remind you the robot actions: 
pick: Pick an object that not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object. 
place: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object. 
bend: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action. 
push: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing. 
fold: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding.

This code consists of four parts below.
1. Object Class (Start with [@dataclass])
2. Action Class (Start with [class Action:])
3. Object initial State (Start with [# Object Initial State])
4. Planning State (Start with [if __name__ == "__main__":])

And this is a planning result of the code.
pick white_3D_cuboid
place white_3D_cuboid
pick blue_3D_cylinder
place blue_3D_cylinder
pick blue_2D_rectangle
Cannot place blue_2D_rectangle
Cannot pick gray_1D_line
Cannot place gray_1D_line
All task planning is done


Here are constraints you should refer.
rules: {'1': 'Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. ', '2': 'Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. ', '3': 'If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. ', '4': 'If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. ', '5': 'Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. '}

Your task is to identify any errors in the preconditions and effects of the action within the given Action class.
!!! One notable thing is that, in many cases, these actions may be error-free. 
Therefore, if no errors are detected, simply return it as is.

Please answer with the template below:
---template start---
First, analyze the error message.
1.
2.
3.

Second, check the error part follows the notes
!!Note1. Do not assume the physical properties of the object.
!!Note2. If a predicate required by the constraints is not defined in the class Object, ignore the constraints please. 
# For example, treating a rigid object as a compressible object. They are different.
# For example, treating a bendable object as a foldable object. They are different.

Third, find the error part of the class Action
# Example
# def place() part is wrong. In our objects set, there is no compressible object. 
# However, the precondtion in 'def place()' violates the Note2 because they make precondtions ~~~

---template end---


A: 
---template start---

First, analyze the error message.
1. The error message indicates that the `place` action for `blue_2D_rectangle` fails because it cannot find a compressible object in the box.
2. The error message also shows that the `pick` action for `gray_1D_line` fails, which implies that the preconditions for picking are not met.
3. The sequence ends with "All task planning is done," indicating that the program completes without crashing, but the actions are not successful for all objects.

Second, check the error part follows the notes
!!Note1. Do not assume the physical properties of the object.
!!Note2. If a predicate required by the constraints is not defined in the class Object, ignore the constraints please. 
# For example, treating a rigid object as a compressible object. They are different.
# For example, treating a bendable object as a foldable object. They are different.

Third, find the error part of the class Action
# The `place()` method is incorrect. The precondition checks for a compressible object in the box before placing a plastic object. However, the code does not define what constitutes a compressible object, violating Note2. The code assumes any object in the box satisfies this condition, which is not correct.
# The `pick()` method fails for `gray_1D_line` because it is plastic and the robot's hand is not empty after the failed `place()` action for `blue_2D_rectangle`. The `pick()` method should ensure the robot's hand is empty before attempting to pick another object.

To fix these issues:
- Modify the `place()` method to allow placing plastic objects without checking for a compressible object, as the constraints for compressible objects are not defined.
- Ensure the `pick()` method resets the robot's state if a `place()` action fails, so the robot's hand is empty for subsequent actions.

Here is the corrected `place()` method:

```python
def place(self, obj, box):
    # Action Description: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object.
    print(f"place {obj.name}")
    box.in_bin_objects.append(obj)
    obj.in_bin = True  # Update the object's state to reflect it is now in the bin
    self.state_handempty()
```

And ensure the `pick()` method resets the state if a `place()` action fails:

```python
def pick(self, obj, box):
    # Preconditions: The object must not be in the bin, and the robot's hand must be empty.
    if not obj.in_bin and self.robot_handempty:
        print(f"pick {obj.name}")
        self.state_holding(obj)
    else:
        print(f"Cannot pick {obj.name}")
        self.state_handempty()  # Reset state if pick fails
```

---template end---
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Now you have to revise precondtions and effect of actions based on class Object and given predicates. 

class Action:
    def __init__(self, name: str = "UR5"):
        self.name = name    
        self.robot_handempty = True
        self.robot_now_holding = False

    def state_handempty(self):
        self.robot_handempty = True
        self.robot_now_holding = False

    def state_holding(self, obj):
        self.robot_handempty = False
        self.robot_now_holding = obj

    def pick(self, obj, box):
        # Preconditions: The object must not be in the bin, and the robot's hand must be empty.
        if not obj.in_bin and self.robot_handempty:
            print(f"pick {obj.name}")
            self.state_holding(obj)
        else:
            print(f"Cannot pick {obj.name}")

    def place(self, obj, box):
        # Action Description: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object.
        if obj.is_plastic:
            # Check if there is a non-rigid object already in the box
            compressible_present = any(not o.is_rigid for o in box.in_bin_objects)
            
            if not compressible_present:
                print(f"Cannot place {obj.name}")
                return

        # If constraints are not applicable or satisfied, proceed with placing the object
        print(f"place {obj.name}")
        box.in_bin_objects.append(obj)
        obj.in_bin = True  # Update the object's state to reflect it is now in the bin
        self.state_handempty()

    def bend(self, obj, box):
        print('Cannot bend')

    def push(self, obj, box):
        print('Cannot push')

    def fold(self, obj, box):
        print('Cannot fold')

    def dummy(self):
        pass
Additionally, you must satisfy the following constraints.
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 
Please revise pre-conditions and effect of the action

And this is the table of goal states where all objects should reach. 
The Goal State

|   2   | blue_2D_rectangle|  True  |
|   3   | gray_1D_line     |  True  |

Fully understand the actions in the Action class and the initial states of all objects. Then tell me your understanding in 300 words.

A: 
The provided code defines a system for simulating actions related to bin packing using a robotic arm. The `Object` class represents items that can be manipulated, with attributes such as `index`, `name`, `color`, `shape`, `object_type`, and physical states like `in_bin`, `is_rigid`, and `is_plastic`. The `Box` class represents containers that can hold objects, with attributes like `index`, `name`, `object_type`, and a list of objects currently in the box (`in_bin_objects`).

The `Action` class models the actions that a robotic arm can perform, specifically focusing on picking and placing objects. The robot has two states: `robot_handempty` and `robot_now_holding`, which track whether the robot's hand is free or holding an object. The `pick` method allows the robot to pick up an object if it is not already in a bin and the robot's hand is empty. The `place` method places an object into a box, with a specific constraint for plastic objects: if the object is plastic, it can only be placed if there is another compressible (plastic) object already in the box. This constraint ensures that compressible objects are not placed alone, possibly to optimize space usage.

The `push` method is designed to handle non-plastic objects, indicating that they can be pushed into the box without additional constraints. The `bend` and `fold` methods are placeholders that currently do not allow any action, possibly indicating that these actions are not applicable to the objects in this context.

The initial state of the objects is defined with specific attributes, and the goal state table indicates that all objects should eventually be packed into a box. The system's logic ensures that objects are manipulated according to their properties and constraints, aiming to achieve the goal state where all objects are packed. The code demonstrates a basic framework for handling object manipulation in a bin-packing scenario, with specific rules for handling different types of objects.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Before start, you must follow the rules: 
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 

Also, we remind you the robot actions: 
pick: Pick an object that not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object. 
place: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object. 
bend: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action. 
push: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing. 
fold: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding.

This code consists of four parts below.
1. Object Class (Start with [@dataclass])
2. Action Class (Start with [class Action:])
3. Object initial State (Start with [# Object Initial State])
4. Planning State (Start with [if __name__ == "__main__":])

And this is a planning result of the code.
pick white_3D_cuboid
place white_3D_cuboid
pick blue_3D_cylinder
place blue_3D_cylinder
pick blue_2D_rectangle
Cannot place blue_2D_rectangle
Cannot pick gray_1D_line
Cannot place gray_1D_line
All task planning is done


Here are constraints you should refer.
rules: {'1': 'Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. ', '2': 'Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. ', '3': 'If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. ', '4': 'If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. ', '5': 'Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. '}

Your task is to identify any errors in the preconditions and effects of the action within the given Action class.
!!! One notable thing is that, in many cases, these actions may be error-free. 
Therefore, if no errors are detected, simply return it as is.

Please answer with the template below:
---template start---
First, analyze the error message.
1.
2.
3.

Second, check the error part follows the notes
!!Note1. Do not assume the physical properties of the object.
!!Note2. If a predicate required by the constraints is not defined in the class Object, ignore the constraints please. 
# For example, treating a rigid object as a compressible object. They are different.
# For example, treating a bendable object as a foldable object. They are different.

Third, find the error part of the class Action
# Example
# def place() part is wrong. In our objects set, there is no compressible object. 
# However, the precondtion in 'def place()' violates the Note2 because they make precondtions ~~~

---template end---


A: 
---template start---

First, analyze the error message.
1. The error message indicates that the action sequence fails when trying to place `blue_2D_rectangle` and `gray_1D_line` due to constraints related to plastic objects.
2. The `Cannot place blue_2D_rectangle` message suggests that the precondition for placing a plastic object is not met.
3. The `Cannot pick gray_1D_line` and `Cannot place gray_1D_line` messages suggest that the sequence does not allow for picking or placing this object due to unmet conditions.

Second, check the error part follows the notes
!!Note1. Do not assume the physical properties of the object.
!!Note2. If a predicate required by the constraints is not defined in the class Object, ignore the constraints please.
# The code correctly identifies objects as plastic or rigid based on their properties.
# The code attempts to apply constraints related to compressible objects, but since compressible is not defined, it should ignore this constraint.

Third, find the error part of the class Action
# The `place()` method is incorrect. It checks for a compressible object before placing a plastic object, but since compressible is not defined in the `Object` class, this constraint should be ignored.
# The precondition in `place()` violates Note2 because it assumes the existence of a compressible object, which is not defined in the `Object` class.
# The correct approach is to allow placing plastic objects without checking for compressible objects, as this constraint is not applicable given the current class definitions.

Q: Now you have to revise precondtions and effect of actions based on class Object and given predicates. 

class Action:
    def __init__(self, name: str = "UR5"):
        self.name = name    
        self.robot_handempty = True
        self.robot_now_holding = False

    def state_handempty(self):
        self.robot_handempty = True
        self.robot_now_holding = False

    def state_holding(self, obj):
        self.robot_handempty = False
        self.robot_now_holding = obj

    def pick(self, obj, box):
        # Preconditions: The object must not be in the bin, and the robot's hand must be empty.
        if not obj.in_bin and self.robot_handempty:
            print(f"pick {obj.name}")
            self.state_holding(obj)
        else:
            print(f"Cannot pick {obj.name}")

    def place(self, obj, box):
        # Action Description: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object.
        if obj.is_plastic:
            # Check if there is a compressible object already in the box
            compressible_present = any(o.is_plastic for o in box.in_bin_objects)
            
            if not compressible_present:
                print(f"Cannot place {obj.name}")
                return

        # If constraints are not applicable or satisfied, proceed with placing the object
        print(f"place {obj.name}")
        box.in_bin_objects.append(obj)
        obj.in_bin = True  # Update the object's state to reflect it is now in the bin
        self.state_handempty()

    def push(self, obj, box):
        # Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box
        if not obj.is_plastic:
            print(f"push {obj.name}")

    def bend(self, obj, box):
        print('Cannot bend')

    def fold(self, obj, box):
        print('Cannot fold')

    def dummy(self):
        pass
Additionally, you must satisfy the following constraints.
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 
Please revise pre-conditions and effect of the action

And this is the table of goal states where all objects should reach. 
The Goal State

|   2   | blue_2D_rectangle|  True  |
|   3   | gray_1D_line     |  True  |

Fully understand the actions in the Action class and the initial states of all objects. Then tell me your understanding in 300 words.

A: 
The provided code defines a system for simulating actions on objects with the goal of packing them into a box. The `Object` class represents individual items, each with properties such as color, shape, type, and whether they are currently in a bin. Objects can be rigid or plastic, and some have a 3D property. The `Box` class represents a container that can hold objects, tracking which objects are currently inside.

The `Action` class models a robot's actions, specifically a robotic arm named "UR5". The robot can perform actions like picking up, placing, pushing, bending, and folding objects. The robot's state is tracked by whether its hand is empty or holding an object. The `pick` action allows the robot to pick up an object if the robot's hand is empty and the object is not already in the bin. The `place` action places an object into a box, updating the object's state to indicate it is now in the bin. The `push` action is intended for compressible objects, but since compressibility is not defined, this constraint is ignored. The `bend` and `fold` actions are not applicable and simply print a message indicating they cannot be performed.

The initial state of the objects includes a mix of rigid and plastic items, with various shapes and dimensions. The goal is to have all objects packed into the box, as indicated by the "Packed" column in the goal state table. The robot must use the defined actions to transition each object from its initial state to the goal state, ensuring all objects are eventually placed in the box.

Overall, the system models a simplified robotic manipulation task, focusing on the sequence of actions required to achieve a specific goal state. The constraints and properties of objects guide the permissible actions, while the robot's state management ensures logical progression through the task.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Before start, you must follow the rules: 
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 

Also, we remind you the robot actions: 
pick: Pick an object that not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object. 
place: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object. 
bend: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action. 
push: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing. 
fold: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding.

A: 
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    # object0.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object1.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object2.is_plastic is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object3.is_plastic is True, actions pick, place are applicable

    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object0: in_bin: True
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: True
    # object3: in_bin: True

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # Based on the rules, we need to ensure that a compressible object is placed before any plastic object.
    # Since compressible is not defined, we assume no object is compressible.
    # Therefore, we can place non-plastic objects first, then plastic objects.

    # Third, make an action sequence.
    # a) Initialize the robot and the box
    action = Action()
    box = Box(index=0, name='box', object_type='box', in_bin_objects=[])

    # b) Action sequence
    # Pick and place non-plastic objects first
    action.pick(object0, box)
    action.place(object0, box)

    action.pick(object1, box)
    action.place(object1, box)

    # Pick and place plastic objects
    action.pick(object2, box)
    action.place(object2, box)

    action.pick(object3, box)
    action.place(object3, box)

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    # The sequence follows the rules by placing non-plastic objects first, as there are no compressible objects defined.
    # Plastic objects are placed without any additional constraints since no compressible objects are defined.
    # The robot's hand is empty before and after each action, maintaining the required state.

    # Finally, add this code    
    print("All task planning is done")
```
