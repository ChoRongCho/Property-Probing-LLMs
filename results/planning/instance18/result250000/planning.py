    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    # object0: is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object1: is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object2: is_foldable is True, actions pick, place, fold are applicable
    # object3: is_bendable is True, actions pick, place, bend are applicable

    # object0: in_bin: True
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: True
    # object3: in_bin: True

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # !!Note1: Common Mistakes! pick -> fold -> place (x), fold -> pick -> place (o) 
    # !!Note2: Do not assume or change the physical properties of the object.
    # Write here.
    # 1. Bend object3 (gray_1D_line) before placing it.
    # 2. Pick and place object3.
    # 3. Fold object2 (blue_2D_rectangle) before placing it.
    # 4. Pick and place object2.
    # 5. Pick and place object0 (white_3D_cuboid).
    # 6. Pick and place object1 (blue_3D_cylinder).

    # Third, make an action sequence.
    # a) Initialize the robot and the box
    action = Action() 
    box = Box(index=0, name='bin', object_type='box', in_bin_objects=[])

    # b) Action sequence
    action.bend(object3, box)  # Bend object3
    action.pick(object3, box)  # Pick object3
    action.place(object3, box) # Place object3

    action.fold(object2, box)  # Fold object2
    action.pick(object2, box)  # Pick object2
    action.place(object2, box) # Place object2

    action.pick(object0, box)  # Pick object0
    action.place(object0, box) # Place object0

    action.pick(object1, box)  # Pick object1
    action.place(object1, box) # Place object1

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    # The sequence follows the rules by bending the bendable object (object3) before placing it,
    # folding the foldable object (object2) before placing it, and ensuring that all objects
    # are placed in the box as per the goal states. The sequence respects the constraints of
    # not bending, folding, or pushing plastic objects, and ensures the robot's hand is empty
    # before and after bending, folding, and pushing actions.

    # Finally, add this code
