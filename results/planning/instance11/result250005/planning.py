    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    # the object0.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # the object1.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # the object2.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # the object3.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable

    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object0: in_bin: True
    # object1: in_bin: True 
    # object2: in_bin: True
    # object3: in_bin: True

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # Since all objects are rigid and non-plastic, they can be placed without additional constraints.
    # The order of placing does not matter as there are no specific constraints for these objects.
    # Example order: object0, object1, object2, object3

    # Third, make an action sequence.
    # a) Initialize the robot and the box

    action.pick(object3, box)
    action.place(object3, box)

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    # All objects are rigid and non-plastic, so they can be picked and placed directly without any additional actions.
    # The robot's hand must be empty before picking each object, and it becomes empty again after placing each object.
    # The sequence ensures that all objects are placed in the box as per the goal states.

    # Finally, add this code
