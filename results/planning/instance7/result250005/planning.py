    # object1: is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object2: is_foldable is True, actions pick, place, fold are applicable
    # object3: is_compressible is True, actions pick, place, push are applicable

    # object0: in_bin: True
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: True
    # object3: in_bin: True

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # 1. Pick object3 (compressible), place it, then push it.
    # 2. Pick object2 (foldable), fold it, then place it.
    # 3. Pick object0 (rigid), place it.
    # 4. Pick object1 (rigid), place it.

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    # The sequence starts with placing the compressible object (object3) first, as it allows subsequent placement of plastic objects if needed.
    # Object2 is foldable, so it is folded before being placed.
    # Objects0 and 1 are rigid and can be placed without additional actions.
    # The sequence respects all constraints, ensuring no actions are performed on plastic objects that are not allowed.
