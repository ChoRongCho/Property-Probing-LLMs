    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    # object0: is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object1: is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object2: is_foldable is True, actions pick, place, fold are applicable
    # object3: is_bendable is True, actions pick, place, bend are applicable
    # object4: is_compressible is True, actions pick, place, push are applicable

    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: True
    # object3: in_bin: True
    # object4: in_bin: True

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # 1. Bend object3 (gray_1D_line) before placing it.
    # 2. Fold object2 (transparent_2D_circle) before placing it.
    # 3. Place object4 (brown_3D_cylinder) and then push it.
    # 4. Place object0 (yellow_3D_cuboid) and object1 (white_3D_cylinder) without additional actions.

    # Non-plastic objects are placed without constraints, and no bending, folding, or pushing is done on plastic objects.
