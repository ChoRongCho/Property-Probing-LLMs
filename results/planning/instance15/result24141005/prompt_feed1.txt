# Object Initial State
object0 = Object(index=0, name='white_3D_cuboid', color='white', shape='3D_cuboid', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=True)
object1 = Object(index=1, name='yellow_3D_cuboid', color='yellow', shape='3D_cuboid', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_compressible=True)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    # object0.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object1.is_compressible is True, actions pick, place, push are applicable
    # object2.is_compressible is True, actions pick, place, push are applicable
    # object3.is_plastic is True, actions pick, place are applicable (with constraints)
    # object4.is_bendable is True, actions pick, bend, place are applicable
    # object5.is_compressible is True, actions pick, place, push are applicable

    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object0: in_bin: True
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: True
    # object3: in_bin: True
    # object4: in_bin: True
    # object5: in_bin: True

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # 1. Bend object4 (black_1D_line) before placing it.
    # 2. Pick and place object1 (yellow_3D_cuboid) and push it.
    # 3. Pick and place object2 (white_3D_cylinder) and push it.
    # 4. Pick and place object5 (brown_3D_cylinder) and push it.
    # 5. Pick and place object3 (blue_2D_rectangle) after a compressible object is in the box.
    # 6. Pick and place object0 (white_3D_cuboid).

    # Third, make an action sequence.
    # a) Initialize the robot and the box
    action = Action()
    box = Box(index=0, name='box1', object_type='box', in_bin_objects=[])

    # b) Action sequence
    action.bend(object4, box)  # Bend the bendable object
    action.pick(object4, box)
    action.place(object4, box)

    action.pick(object1, box)
    action.place(object1, box)
    action.push(object1, box)

    action.pick(object2, box)
    action.place(object2, box)
    action.push(object2, box)

    action.pick(object5, box)
    action.place(object5, box)
    action.push(object5, box)

    action.pick(object3, box)
    action.place(object3, box)

    action.pick(object0, box)
    action.place(object0, box)

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    # The sequence follows the rules: bend the bendable object first, place a compressible object before a plastic one,
    # and push all compressible objects after placing them. The sequence ensures all objects are packed according to their properties.

    # Finally, add this code    
    print("All task planning is done")

 
This code consists of four parts below.
1. Object Class (Start with [@dataclass])
2. Action Class (Start with [class Action:])
3. Object initial State (Start with [# Object Initial State])
4. Planning State (Start with [if __name__ == "__main__":])

And this is a planning result of the code.
bend black_1D_line
pick black_1D_line
place black_1D_line
pick yellow_3D_cuboid
place yellow_3D_cuboid
Cannot push yellow_3D_cuboid
pick white_3D_cylinder
place white_3D_cylinder
Cannot push white_3D_cylinder
pick brown_3D_cylinder
place brown_3D_cylinder
Cannot push brown_3D_cylinder
pick blue_2D_rectangle
place blue_2D_rectangle
pick white_3D_cuboid
place white_3D_cuboid
All task planning is done


Here are constraints you should refer.
rules: {'1': 'Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. ', '2': 'Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. ', '3': 'If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. ', '4': 'If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. ', '5': 'Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. '}

Your task is to identify any errors in the preconditions and effects of the action within the given Action class.
!!! One notable thing is that, in many cases, these actions may be error-free. 
Therefore, if no errors are detected, simply return it as is.

Please answer with the template below:
---template start---
First, analyze the error message.
1.
2.
3.

Second, check the error part follows the notes
!!Note1. Do not assume the physical properties of the object.
!!Note2. If a predicate required by the constraints is not defined in the class Object, ignore the constraints please. 
# For example, treating a rigid object as a compressible object. They are different.
# For example, treating a bendable object as a foldable object. They are different.

Third, find the error part of the class Action
# Example
# def place() part is wrong. In our objects set, there is no compressible object. 
# However, the precondtion in 'def place()' violates the Note2 because they make precondtions ~~~

---template end---


A: 
---template start---

First, analyze the error message.
1. The error message indicates that the `push` action for compressible objects (yellow_3D_cuboid, white_3D_cylinder, brown_3D_cylinder) is not being executed successfully, as indicated by "Cannot push".
2. The `place` action for the blue_2D_rectangle (plastic object) is executed without any issue, which aligns with the constraints.
3. The sequence of actions seems to follow the given rules, but the `push` action fails for compressible objects.

Second, check the error part follows the notes
!!Note1. Do not assume the physical properties of the object.
!!Note2. If a predicate required by the constraints is not defined in the class Object, ignore the constraints please. 
# For example, treating a rigid object as a compressible object. They are different.
# For example, treating a bendable object as a foldable object. They are different.

Third, find the error part of the class Action
# The `push` method is incorrect. The precondition for `push` requires the object to be in the bin (`obj.in_bin`), but this attribute is not updated when the object is placed in the box. 
# The `place` method should update `obj.in_bin` to `True` after placing the object in the box.
# Correct the `place` method to include `obj.in_bin = True` after `box.in_bin_objects.append(obj)` to ensure the `push` action can be executed.

Q: Now you have to revise precondtions and effect of actions based on class Object and given predicates. 

class Action:
    def __init__(self, name: str = "UR5"):
        self.name = name

        if not obj.in_bin and self.robot_handempty:
            # Action Description: Pick an object that is not in the box.
            print(f"pick {obj.name}")
            # Effects: The robot is now holding the object, and its hand is no longer empty.
            self.state_holding(obj)
        else:
            print(f"Cannot pick {obj.name}")

    def place(self, obj, box):
        # Action Description: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object.
        # Check if the object is plastic and if the constraint is applicable
        if obj.is_plastic:
            # Check if there's a compressible object already in the box
            if any(o.is_compressible for o in box.in_bin_objects):
                print(f"place {obj.name}")
                self.state_handempty()  # Assuming placing the object means the robot hand is now empty
                box.in_bin_objects.append(obj)  # Add the object to the box
            else:
                print(f"Cannot place {obj.name} because no compressible object is in the box")
        else:
            # Non-plastic objects can be placed without constraints
            print(f"place {obj.name}")
            self.state_handempty()  # Assuming placing the object means the robot hand is now empty
            box.in_bin_objects.append(obj)  # Add the object to the box

    def bend(self, obj, box):
        # Action Description: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action.
        # Note! If a predicate required by the constraints is absent from the class Object, do not consider the constraints.
        
        # Check if the object is bendable and the robot's hand is empty
        if obj.is_bendable and self.robot_handempty:
            print(f"bend {obj.name}")
            # State the effect of Action: Hand remains empty after bending
            self.state_handempty()
        else:
            print(f"Cannot bend {obj.name}")

    def push(self, obj, box):
        # Preconditions: The object must be compressible and in the bin, and the robot's hand must be empty.
        if obj.is_compressible and obj.in_bin and self.robot_handempty:
            # Action Description: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. 
            # Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing.
            print(f"push {obj.name}")
            # Effects: The robot's hand remains empty after the action.
            self.state_handempty()
        else:
            print(f"Cannot push {obj.name}")

    def fold(self, obj, box):
        print('Cannot fold')

    def dummy(self):
        pass
Additionally, you must satisfy the following constraints.
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 
Please revise pre-conditions and effect of the action

object4 = Object(index=4, name='black_1D_line', color='black', shape='1D_line', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_bendable=True)
object5 = Object(index=5, name='brown_3D_cylinder', color='brown', shape='3D_cylinder', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_compressible=True)

And this is the table of goal states where all objects should reach. 
The Goal State
| Index | Name             | Packed |
|-------|------------------|--------|
|   0   | white_3D_cuboid  |  True  |
|   1   | yellow_3D_cuboid |  True  |
|   2   | white_3D_cylinder|  True  |
|   3   | blue_2D_rectangle|  True  |
|   4   | black_1D_line    |  True  |
|   5   | brown_3D_cylinder|  True  |

Fully understand the actions in the Action class and the initial states of all objects. Then tell me your understanding in 300 words.

A: 
The provided code defines a simple simulation of a robotic system tasked with packing objects into a box. The system is modeled using Python classes and dataclasses to represent objects, boxes, and actions. The `Object` class describes various attributes of an object, including its physical properties (e.g., rigidity, compressibility, bendability, and plasticity) and its current state (e.g., whether it is in a bin). The `Box` class represents a container that can hold objects, tracking which objects are currently inside it.

The `Action` class encapsulates the robot's capabilities, such as picking, placing, bending, pushing, and folding objects. The robot can only perform certain actions based on the object's properties and its own state (e.g., whether its hand is empty). For instance, the `pick` action requires the robot's hand to be empty and the object not to be in the bin. The `place` action allows placing objects into a box, with special conditions for plastic objects that require a compressible object already in the box. The `bend` action is only possible for bendable objects when the robot's hand is empty. The `push` action is restricted to compressible objects already in the bin and requires the robot's hand to be empty. The `fold` action is not implemented, indicating that folding is not a permissible action.

The initial state of the objects is defined, with various attributes set to reflect their physical properties and initial conditions (e.g., not in a bin). The goal state table specifies that all objects should eventually be packed into the box, marked by the `Packed` attribute being `True` for each object. The challenge lies in sequencing the actions to transition each object from its initial state to the goal state, considering the constraints imposed by the object's properties and the robot's capabilities.

Q: Before start, you must follow the rules: 
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 

Also, we remind you the robot actions: 
pick: Pick an object that not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object. 
place: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object. 
bend: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action. 
push: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing. 
fold: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding. 

        
Please answer with the template below:
---template start---

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    <Example>
    # the object1.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # the object2.is_foldable is True, actions pick, place, fold are applicable
    # the object3.is_compressible is True, actions pick, place, push are applicable
    # ...
    
    <Example>
    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: False 
    # object3: in_bin: True
    # ...

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # !!Note1: Common Mistakes! pick -> fold -> place (x), fold -> pick -> place (o) 
    # !!Note2: Do not assume or change the physical properties of the object.
    # Write here.


    # Third, make an action sequence.
    # a) Initialize the robot and the box
    action = Action() 
    box = Box(...)

    # b) Action sequence
    

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    ...

    # Finally, add this code
