    # object1 is a 3D cuboid, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object2 is a 3D cylinder, actions pick, place are applicable

    # object0: in_bin: True
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: True

    # Since none of the objects have additional properties like compressible, bendable, or foldable,
    # we can directly pick and place each object into the box.

    # The objects were picked and placed into the box without any additional actions like bending, folding, or pushing,
    # as none of the objects had properties that required such actions. The robot's hand was empty before and after each
    # pick and place action, adhering to the rules.
