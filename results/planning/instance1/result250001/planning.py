    # object0: in_bin: True
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: True

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # !!Note1: Common Mistakes! pick -> fold -> place (x), fold -> pick -> place (o)
    # !!Note2: Do not assume or change the physical properties of the object.

    # The sequence starts with the compressible object (object2) because it needs to be pushed after placing.
    # Once a compressible object is in the box, the rigid objects (object0 and object1) can be placed without constraints.
    # The sequence respects the rules by ensuring no bending or folding actions are applied to any objects, as none are bendable or foldable.
