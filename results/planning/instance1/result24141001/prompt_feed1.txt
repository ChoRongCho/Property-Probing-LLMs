# Object Initial State

object1 = Object(index=1, name='white_3D_cuboid', color='white', shape='3D_cuboid', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_plastic=False, is_rigid=True, is_heavy=False)
object2 = Object(index=2, name='green_3D_cylinder', color='green', shape='3D_cylinder', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_plastic=False, is_rigid=True, is_heavy=False)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    # the object0.is_plastic is True, object0.is_rigid is False, actions pick, place are applicable
    # the object1.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # the object2.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable

    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object0: in_bin: True
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: True

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # 1. Pick and place object1 (white_3D_cuboid) since it is non-plastic and can be placed without constraints.
    # 2. Pick and place object2 (green_3D_cylinder) since it is non-plastic and can be placed without constraints.
    # 3. Pick and place object0 (red_3D_cuboid) after object1 or object2 is in the box, as it is plastic and requires a compressible object in the box.

    # Third, make an action sequence.
    # a) Initialize the robot and the box
    action = Action() 
    box = Box(index=0, name='box1', object_type='box', in_bin_objects=[])

    # b) Action sequence
    action.pick(object1, box)
    action.place(object1, box)
    action.pick(object2, box)
    action.place(object2, box)
    action.pick(object0, box)
    action.place(object0, box)

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    # The sequence starts with placing non-plastic objects (object1 and object2) as they have no constraints.
    # Once a non-plastic object is in the box, the plastic object (object0) can be placed.
    # This sequence respects the rule that a plastic object requires a compressible object in the box before it can be placed.
    # No bending, folding, or pushing actions are necessary as none of the objects are bendable, foldable, or compressible.

    # Finally, add this code    
    print("All task planning is done")

 
This code consists of four parts below.
1. Object Class (Start with [@dataclass])
2. Action Class (Start with [class Action:])
3. Object initial State (Start with [# Object Initial State])
4. Planning State (Start with [if __name__ == "__main__":])

And this is a planning result of the code.
pick white_3D_cuboid
place white_3D_cuboid
pick green_3D_cylinder
place green_3D_cylinder
pick red_3D_cuboid
Cannot place red_3D_cuboid
All task planning is done


Here are constraints you should refer.
rules: {'1': 'Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. ', '2': 'Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. ', '3': 'If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. ', '4': 'If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. ', '5': 'Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. '}

Your task is to identify any errors in the preconditions and effects of the action within the given Action class.
!!! One notable thing is that, in many cases, these actions may be error-free. 
Therefore, if no errors are detected, simply return it as is.

Please answer with the template below:
---template start---
First, analyze the error message.
1.
2.
3.

Second, check the error part follows the notes
!!Note1. Do not assume the physical properties of the object.
!!Note2. If a predicate required by the constraints is not defined in the class Object, ignore the constraints please. 
# For example, treating a rigid object as a compressible object. They are different.
# For example, treating a bendable object as a foldable object. They are different.

Third, find the error part of the class Action
# Example
# def place() part is wrong. In our objects set, there is no compressible object. 
# However, the precondtion in 'def place()' violates the Note2 because they make precondtions ~~~

---template end---


A: 
---template start---

First, analyze the error message.
1. The error message indicates that the action sequence fails when attempting to place the `red_3D_cuboid` object.
2. The failure occurs because the `place` method's precondition for placing a plastic object is not met.
3. The precondition requires a compressible object to be in the box before placing a plastic object, but the current implementation incorrectly checks for non-rigid objects as compressible.

Second, check the error part follows the notes
!!Note1. Do not assume the physical properties of the object.
!!Note2. If a predicate required by the constraints is not defined in the class Object, ignore the constraints please.
# For example, treating a rigid object as a compressible object. They are different.
# For example, treating a bendable object as a foldable object. They are different.

Third, find the error part of the class Action
# The `place()` method is incorrect. It checks for non-rigid objects to determine if a compressible object is present, which violates Note2.
# The current implementation assumes non-rigid objects are compressible, which is not defined in the class `Object`.
# To fix this, the code should either define a compressible property in the `Object` class or remove the check for compressibility.

---template end---
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Now you have to revise precondtions and effect of actions based on class Object and given predicates. 

class Action:
    def __init__(self, name: str = "UR5"):
        self.name = name    
        self.robot_handempty = True
        self.robot_now_holding = False

    # basic state
    def state_handempty(self):
        self.robot_handempty = True
        self.robot_now_holding = False

    # basic state
    def state_holding(self, obj):
        self.robot_handempty = False
        self.robot_now_holding = obj

    def pick(self, obj, box):
        # Action Description: Pick an object that is not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object.
        if not obj.in_bin and self.robot_handempty:
            print(f"pick {obj.name}")
            # Effect: Update the state to reflect that the robot is now holding the object
            self.state_holding(obj)
        else:
            print(f"Cannot pick {obj.name}")

    def place(self, obj, box):
        # Check if the object is plastic and if the constraint should be considered
        if obj.is_plastic:
            # Check if there is at least one compressible object already in the box
            compressible_present = any(not o.is_rigid for o in box.in_bin_objects)
            if not compressible_present:
                print(f"Cannot place {obj.name}")
                return

        # Action Description: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object.
        print(f"place {obj.name}")
        
        # Update the state to reflect the object is now in the box
        obj.in_bin = True
        box.in_bin_objects.append(obj)
        
        # Update the robot's state to hand empty after placing the object
        self.state_handempty()

    def bend(self, obj, box):
        print('Cannot bend')

    def push(self, obj, box):
        print('Cannot push')

    def fold(self, obj, box):
        print('Cannot fold')

    def dummy(self):
        pass
Additionally, you must satisfy the following constraints.
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 
Please revise pre-conditions and effect of the action

Q: Refer the following code containing the list of actions (class Action) and the set of initial states of objects which are defined in class Object.

# Object Initial State
object0 = Object(index=0, name='red_3D_cuboid', color='red', shape='3D_cuboid', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_plastic=True, is_rigid=False, is_heavy=False)
object1 = Object(index=1, name='white_3D_cuboid', color='white', shape='3D_cuboid', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_plastic=False, is_rigid=True, is_heavy=False)
object2 = Object(index=2, name='green_3D_cylinder', color='green', shape='3D_cylinder', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_plastic=False, is_rigid=True, is_heavy=False)

And this is the table of goal states where all objects should reach. 
The Goal State
| Index | Name            | Packed |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
|   0   | red_3D_cuboid   |  True  |
|   1   | white_3D_cuboid |  True  |
|   2   | green_3D_cylinder |  True  |

Fully understand the actions in the Action class and the initial states of all objects. Then tell me your understanding in 300 words.

A: 
The provided code defines a simple simulation of a robotic system tasked with packing objects into a box. The system is modeled using Python classes, specifically leveraging the `dataclass` decorator for easy definition of data structures. The `Object` class represents items that can be manipulated by the robot, with attributes such as `index`, `name`, `color`, `shape`, `object_type`, and physical properties like `is_plastic`, `is_rigid`, and `is_heavy`. The `in_bin` attribute indicates whether the object is currently packed in a box.

The `Box` class represents a container that can hold objects. It has attributes like `index`, `name`, `object_type`, and a list `in_bin_objects` to track objects placed inside.

The `Action` class models the robot's capabilities, with methods to manipulate objects. The robot can perform actions like `pick` and `place`. The `pick` method allows the robot to pick up an object if it is not already in a box and the robot's hand is empty. The `place` method places an object into a box, with a constraint for plastic objects: they can only be placed if there is at least one non-rigid (compressible) object already in the box. This constraint is checked using a generator expression that iterates over the objects in the box.

The initial state of the system is defined with three objects: `object0` (a red, non-rigid, plastic cuboid), `object1` (a white, rigid cuboid), and `object2` (a green, rigid cylinder). None of these objects are initially in the box.

The goal state requires all objects to be packed in the box. The robot must use its `pick` and `place` actions to achieve this, considering the constraints on plastic objects. The `bend`, `push`, and `fold` methods are placeholders and currently do not perform any actions. The `dummy` method is also a placeholder for potential future functionality. The system's design emphasizes simplicity and clarity, focusing on basic object manipulation and state transitions.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Before start, you must follow the rules: 
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 

Also, we remind you the robot actions: 
pick: Pick an object that not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object. 
place: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object. 
bend: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action. 
push: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing. 
fold: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding.

    # Finally, add this code    
    print("All task planning is done")
