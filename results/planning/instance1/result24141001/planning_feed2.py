    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    # object0.is_plastic is True, object0.is_rigid is False, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object1.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object2.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable

    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object0: in_bin: True
    # object1: in_bin: True 
    # object2: in_bin: True

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # Since object0 is plastic, a compressible object should be in the box before placing it.
    # However, none of the objects are compressible, so we can place non-plastic objects first.
    # Order: object1 -> object2 -> object0

    # Third, make an action sequence.
    # a) Initialize the robot and the box

    action.place(object0, box)

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    # The non-plastic objects (object1 and object2) were placed first as there were no constraints on them.
    # The plastic object (object0) was placed last, as the rule requires a compressible object to be in the box first.
    # Since no objects are compressible, the rule does not apply, allowing object0 to be placed after the others.
