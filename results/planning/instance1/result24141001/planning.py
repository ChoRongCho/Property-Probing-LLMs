    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    # the object0.is_plastic is True, object0.is_rigid is False, actions pick, place are applicable
    # the object1.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # the object2.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable

    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object0: in_bin: True
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: True

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # 1. Pick and place object1 (white_3D_cuboid) since it is non-plastic and can be placed without constraints.
    # 2. Pick and place object2 (green_3D_cylinder) since it is non-plastic and can be placed without constraints.
    # 3. Pick and place object0 (red_3D_cuboid) after object1 or object2 is in the box, as it is plastic and requires a compressible object in the box.

    # Third, make an action sequence.
    # a) Initialize the robot and the box
    action = Action() 
    box = Box(index=0, name='box1', object_type='box', in_bin_objects=[])

    action.place(object1, box)
    action.pick(object2, box)
    action.place(object2, box)
    action.pick(object0, box)
    action.place(object0, box)

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    # The sequence starts with placing non-plastic objects (object1 and object2) as they have no constraints.
    # Once a non-plastic object is in the box, the plastic object (object0) can be placed.
    # This sequence respects the rule that a plastic object requires a compressible object in the box before it can be placed.
    # No bending, folding, or pushing actions are necessary as none of the objects are bendable, foldable, or compressible.

    # Finally, add this code
