    # object1: is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object2: is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable

    # object0: in_bin: True
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: True

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # Since all objects are rigid and non-plastic, we can directly pick and place them without additional constraints.
    # The order of placing does not matter in this case as there are no special conditions like compressible or foldable.

    # The robot's hand must be empty before picking and after placing each object, which is ensured by the sequence of actions.
    # The goal states are achieved as all objects are placed in the box.
