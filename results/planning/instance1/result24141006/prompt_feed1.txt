# Object Initial State
object0 = Object(index=0, name='red_3D_cuboid', color='red', shape='3D_cuboid', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_plastic=True, is_rigid=False, is_heavy=False)
object1 = Object(index=1, name='white_3D_cuboid', color='white', shape='3D_cuboid', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_plastic=False, is_rigid=True, is_heavy=False)
object2 = Object(index=2, name='green_3D_cylinder', color='green', shape='3D_cylinder', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_plastic=False, is_rigid=True, is_heavy=False)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    # object0.is_rigid is False, object0.is_plastic is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object1.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object2.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable

    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object0: in_bin: True
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: True

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # Since object0 is plastic and not rigid, it requires a compressible object in the box first.
    # object1 and object2 can be placed without constraints.
    # Order: pick object1 -> place object1 -> pick object2 -> place object2 -> pick object0 -> place object0

    # Third, make an action sequence.
    # a) Initialize the robot and the box
    action = Action() 
    box = Box(index=0, name='box1', object_type='box', in_bin_objects=[])

    # b) Action sequence

    action.place(object1, box)
    action.pick(object2, box)
    action.place(object2, box)
    action.pick(object0, box)
    action.place(object0, box)

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    # object1 and object2 are non-plastic and rigid, so they can be placed without constraints.
    # object0 is plastic and requires a compressible object in the box, which is satisfied by object1 or object2 being in the box first.
    # All actions are performed in compliance with the rules, ensuring that the constraints are respected.

    # Finally, add this code    
    print("All task planning is done")

 
This code consists of four parts below.
1. Object Class (Start with [@dataclass])
2. Action Class (Start with [class Action:])
3. Object initial State (Start with [# Object Initial State])
4. Planning State (Start with [if __name__ == "__main__":])

And this is a planning result of the code.
pick white_3D_cuboid
place white_3D_cuboid
pick green_3D_cylinder
place green_3D_cylinder
pick red_3D_cuboid
Cannot place red_3D_cuboid
All task planning is done


Here are constraints you should refer.
rules: {'1': 'Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. ', '2': 'Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. ', '3': 'If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. ', '4': 'If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. ', '5': 'Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. '}

Your task is to identify any errors in the preconditions and effects of the action within the given Action class.
!!! One notable thing is that, in many cases, these actions may be error-free. 
Therefore, if no errors are detected, simply return it as is.

Please answer with the template below:
---template start---
First, analyze the error message.
1.
2.
3.

Second, check the error part follows the notes
!!Note1. Do not assume the physical properties of the object.
!!Note2. If a predicate required by the constraints is not defined in the class Object, ignore the constraints please. 
# For example, treating a rigid object as a compressible object. They are different.
# For example, treating a bendable object as a foldable object. They are different.

Third, find the error part of the class Action
# Example
# def place() part is wrong. In our objects set, there is no compressible object. 
# However, the precondtion in 'def place()' violates the Note2 because they make precondtions ~~~

---template end---


A: 
---template start---

First, analyze the error message.
1. The error message indicates that the action sequence failed at the step "place red_3D_cuboid" with the message "Cannot place red_3D_cuboid".
2. This suggests that the precondition for placing the red_3D_cuboid (object0) was not met.
3. The code logic for placing a plastic object requires a compressible object to be in the box first, but the error message indicates this condition was not satisfied.

Second, check the error part follows the notes
!!Note1. Do not assume the physical properties of the object.
!!Note2. If a predicate required by the constraints is not defined in the class Object, ignore the constraints please. 
# The code correctly identifies that object0 is plastic and not rigid, which means it requires a compressible object in the box before it can be placed.
# The code checks for the presence of a compressible object in the box before placing a plastic object, which aligns with the given constraints.

Third, find the error part of the class Action
# The error is in the logic of the `place` method in the Action class.
# The precondition for placing a plastic object requires a compressible object to be in the box, but the code incorrectly checks for a non-rigid object.
# In the current object set, object0 is the only non-rigid (compressible) object, and it cannot be placed first.
# The correct logic should allow placing object0 only after object1 or object2, which are rigid, are placed in the box.
# Therefore, the error is not in the code logic but in the sequence of actions. The sequence should be adjusted to:
# Order: pick object1 -> place object1 -> pick object0 -> place object0 -> pick object2 -> place object2

---template end---
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Now you have to revise precondtions and effect of actions based on class Object and given predicates. 

class Action:
    def __init__(self, name: str = "UR5"):
        self.name = name    
        self.robot_handempty = True
        self.robot_now_holding = False

    # basic state
    def state_handempty(self):
        self.robot_handempty = True
        self.robot_now_holding = False

    # basic state
    def state_holding(self, obj):
        self.robot_handempty = False
        self.robot_now_holding = obj

    def pick(self, obj, box):
        # Preconditions: The object is not in the bin, and the robot's hand is empty.
        if not obj.in_bin and self.robot_handempty:
            # Action Description: Pick an object that is not in the box. 
            # The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object.
            print(f"pick {obj.name}")
            # Effect: The robot is now holding the object, and the hand is not empty.
            self.state_holding(obj)
        else:
            print(f"Cannot pick {obj.name}")

    def place(self, obj, box):
        # Action Description: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object.
        # Note! If a predicate required by the constraints is absent from the class Object, do not consider the constraints.
        
        # Check if the object is plastic and if the constraint applies
        if obj.is_plastic:
            # Check if there is at least one compressible object in the box
            compressible_present = any(not o.is_rigid for o in box.in_bin_objects)
            if not compressible_present:
                print(f"Cannot place {obj.name}")
                return
        
        # Place the object in the box
        box.in_bin_objects.append(obj)
        obj.in_bin = True
        self.state_handempty()
        print(f"place {obj.name}")

    def bend(self, obj, box):
        print('Cannot bend')

    def push(self, obj, box):
        print('Cannot push')

    def fold(self, obj, box):
        print('Cannot fold')

    def dummy(self):
        pass
Additionally, you must satisfy the following constraints.
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 
Please revise pre-conditions and effect of the action

Q: Refer the following code containing the list of actions (class Action) and the set of initial states of objects which are defined in class Object.

            rigid_present = any(o.is_rigid for o in box.in_bin_objects)
            if not rigid_present:

# Object Initial State
object0 = Object(index=0, name='red_3D_cuboid', color='red', shape='3D_cuboid', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_plastic=True, is_rigid=False, is_heavy=False)
object1 = Object(index=1, name='white_3D_cuboid', color='white', shape='3D_cuboid', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_plastic=False, is_rigid=True, is_heavy=False)
object2 = Object(index=2, name='green_3D_cylinder', color='green', shape='3D_cylinder', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_plastic=False, is_rigid=True, is_heavy=False)

And this is the table of goal states where all objects should reach. 
The Goal State
| Index | Name            | Packed |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
|   0   | red_3D_cuboid   |  True  |
|   1   | white_3D_cuboid |  True  |
|   2   | green_3D_cylinder | True  |

Fully understand the actions in the Action class and the initial states of all objects. Then tell me your understanding in 300 words.

A: 
The provided code defines a simple simulation of a robotic system tasked with packing objects into a box. The system is modeled using Python classes, specifically leveraging the `dataclass` decorator for the `Object` and `Box` classes to simplify the creation of these data structures.

The `Object` class represents items that can be manipulated by the robot. Each object has properties such as `index`, `name`, `color`, `shape`, `object_type`, and physical states like `in_bin`, `is_plastic`, `is_rigid`, and `is_heavy`. These properties help determine how the robot can interact with the objects, particularly focusing on whether they are plastic or rigid, which affects the constraints for placing them in a box.

The `Box` class represents a container that can hold objects. It has an `index`, `name`, `object_type`, and a list `in_bin_objects` to track which objects are currently inside the box.

The `Action` class models the robot's capabilities, with methods to simulate picking and placing objects. The robot can only pick an object if it is not already in the bin and the robot's hand is empty. When placing objects, a constraint is enforced for plastic objects: they can only be placed if there is at least one rigid object already in the box. This constraint ensures stability or safety in the packing process.

The initial state of the system includes three objects: `red_3D_cuboid`, `white_3D_cuboid`, and `green_3D_cylinder`. None of these objects are initially in the bin. The goal is to have all objects packed into the box, as indicated by the goal state table where the `Packed` status for each object should be `True`.

The robot's actions are limited to picking and placing objects, with other actions like bending, pushing, and folding being unavailable. The system's design emphasizes simplicity and constraint-based decision-making, focusing on the interaction between object properties and the robot's capabilities to achieve the desired goal state.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Before start, you must follow the rules: 
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 

Also, we remind you the robot actions: 
pick: Pick an object that not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object. 
place: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object. 
bend: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action. 
push: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing. 
fold: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding.

    action.pick(object2, box)
    action.place(object2, box)

    action.pick(object0, box)
    action.place(object0, box)

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    # The sequence starts with placing rigid objects (object1 and object2) which have no constraints.
    # Object1 is assumed to be compressible and is pushed after placing.
    # Object0 is plastic and requires a compressible object in the box before placing, which is satisfied by object1.
    # The sequence ensures all objects are placed in the box following the rules.

    # Finally, add this code    
    print("All task planning is done")
```

Note: The assumption that object1 is compressible is made for the sake of demonstrating the push action, as the initial code does not specify compressibility. Adjust the sequence based on actual object properties if necessary.
