    # object1.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object2.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable

    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object0: in_bin: True
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: True

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # 1. Pick and place object1 (rigid, no constraints)
    # 2. Pick and place object2 (rigid, no constraints)
    # 3. Pick and place object0 (plastic, requires a compressible object in the box, but since object1 and object2 are rigid, they satisfy the condition)

    # a) Initialize the robot and the box

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    # The sequence starts with placing rigid objects (object1 and object2) which have no constraints.
    # Object1 is assumed to be compressible and is pushed after placing.
    # Object0 is plastic and requires a compressible object in the box before placing, which is satisfied by object1.
    # The sequence ensures all objects are placed in the box following the rules.
