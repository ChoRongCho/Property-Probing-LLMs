    # object0: in_bin: True
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: True

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # 1. Pick object1 (white_3D_cuboid) and place it in the box.
    # 2. Pick object2 (green_3D_cylinder) and place it in the box.

    # Object2 is pushed after placing since it's compressible.
    # Finally, object0, which is plastic, is placed last because the box already contains a compressible object (object2), satisfying the constraint.
