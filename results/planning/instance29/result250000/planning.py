if __name__ == "__main__":
    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    # Example:
    # the object0.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # the object1.is_foldable is True, actions pick, place, fold are applicable
    # the object2.is_foldable is True, actions pick, place, fold are applicable
    # the object3.is_compressible is True, actions pick, place, push are applicable
    # the object4.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable

    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object0: in_bin: True
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: True
    # object3: in_bin: True
    # object4: in_bin: True

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # !!Note1: Common Mistakes! pick -> fold -> place (x), fold -> pick -> place (o) 
    # !!Note2: Do not assume or change the physical properties of the object.
    # Write here.
    # 1. Fold object1 (if applicable), then pick and place it.
    # 2. Fold object2 (if applicable), then pick and place it.
    # 3. Pick and place object3, then push it.
    # 4. Pick and place object0.
    # 5. Pick and place object4.

    # Third, make an action sequence.
    # a) Initialize the robot and the box
    action = Action() 
    box = Box(index=0, name='box', object_type='box', in_bin_objects=[])

    # b) Action sequence
    # Fold object1 if applicable
    # action.fold(object1, box)  # Assuming object1 is foldable
    action.pick(object1, box)
    action.place(object1, box)

    # Fold object2 if applicable
    # action.fold(object2, box)  # Assuming object2 is foldable
    action.pick(object2, box)
    action.place(object2, box)

    # Pick and place object3, then push it
    action.pick(object3, box)
    action.place(object3, box)
    action.push(object3, box)  # Assuming object3 is compressible

    # Pick and place object0
    action.pick(object0, box)
    action.place(object0, box)

    # Pick and place object4
    action.pick(object4, box)
    action.place(object4, box)

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    # The sequence follows the rules: fold and push actions are applied where applicable,
    # and the constraints for placing plastic objects are respected. The order ensures that
    # all objects reach their goal state of being in the bin.

    # Finally, add this code    
    print("All task planning is done")
