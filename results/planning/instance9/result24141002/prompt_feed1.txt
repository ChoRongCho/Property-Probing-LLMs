    def dummy(self):

# Object Initial State
object0 = Object(index=0, name='red_3D_cuboid', color='red', shape='3D_cuboid', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_plastic=True)
object1 = Object(index=1, name='blue_3D_cylinder', color='blue', shape='3D_cylinder', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=True)
object2 = Object(index=2, name='transparent_2D_circle', color='transparent', shape='2D_circle', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_foldable=True)
object3 = Object(index=3, name='black_1D_line', color='black', shape='1D_line', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_bendable=True)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    # the object0.is_plastic is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # the object1.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # the object2.is_foldable is True, actions pick, place, fold are applicable
    # the object3.is_bendable is True, actions pick, place, bend are applicable
    
    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object0: in_bin: True
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: True
    # object3: in_bin: True

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # !!Note1: Common Mistakes! pick -> fold -> place (x), fold -> pick -> place (o) 
    # !!Note2: Do not assume or change the physical properties of the object.
    # Write here.
    # 1. Bend object3 (black_1D_line) before placing it.
    # 2. Fold object2 (transparent_2D_circle) before placing it.
    # 3. Place object2 in the box.
    # 4. Place object3 in the box.
    # 5. Place object1 (blue_3D_cylinder) in the box.
    # 6. Place object0 (red_3D_cuboid) in the box, ensuring a compressible object is already in the box.

    # Third, make an action sequence.
    # a) Initialize the robot and the box
    action = Action() 
    box = Box(index=0, name='box', object_type='box', in_bin_objects=[])

    # b) Action sequence
    action.bend(object3, box)  # Bend the bendable object
    action.fold(object2, box)  # Fold the foldable object
    action.pick(object2, box)  # Pick the foldable object
    action.place(object2, box) # Place the foldable object
    action.pick(object3, box)  # Pick the bendable object
    action.place(object3, box) # Place the bendable object
    action.pick(object1, box)  # Pick the rigid object
    action.place(object1, box) # Place the rigid object
    action.pick(object0, box)  # Pick the plastic object
    action.place(object0, box) # Place the plastic object

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    # The sequence follows the rules: bend and fold actions are performed before placing the respective objects.
    # Object2 (foldable) is placed first to satisfy the condition for placing the plastic object (object0).
    # Object3 (bendable) is bent before being placed.
    # Object1 (rigid) is placed without additional constraints.
    # Object0 (plastic) is placed last, ensuring a compressible object is already in the box.

    # Finally, add this code    
    print("All task planning is done")

 
This code consists of four parts below.
1. Object Class (Start with [@dataclass])
2. Action Class (Start with [class Action:])
3. Object initial State (Start with [# Object Initial State])
4. Planning State (Start with [if __name__ == "__main__":])

And this is a planning result of the code.

  File "/home/changmin/PycharmProjects/OPTPlan/result_planning/instance9/result24141002/planning.py", line 64
    if obj.is_plastic and (obj.is_foldable or obj.is_bendable):
    ^
IndentationError: expected an indented block after function definition on line 62


Identify any incorrect parts and revise the faulty sections based on the provided planning results.

---template start---
### Wrong part (Select only one from the planning result.)
1. Object Class 
2. Action Class 
3. Object initial State 
4. Planning State 

### Reason (Tell me your understanding in 300 words.)

### Revised version (Revise the wrong part selected above.)
```python
# 2. Action Class (example)
```
---template end---


A: 
### Wrong part
2. Action Class 

### Reason
The error in the code is due to incorrect indentation in the `place` method of the `Action` class. In Python, indentation is crucial as it defines the blocks of code. The error message indicates that the `if` statement inside the `place` method is not properly indented, which causes an `IndentationError`. This error suggests that the `if` statement is expected to be part of the `place` method, but due to incorrect indentation, Python does not recognize it as such. This is a common mistake when writing Python code, especially when dealing with nested blocks or complex logic. The `place` method should have all its logic properly indented to ensure that it is recognized as part of the method's body. This includes ensuring that all conditional checks and actions within the method are aligned correctly. Proper indentation not only prevents syntax errors but also improves code readability and maintainability. By fixing the indentation, the code will execute as intended, allowing the `place` method to perform its function of placing objects into the box according to the specified conditions and constraints.

### Revised version
```python
# 2. Action Class
