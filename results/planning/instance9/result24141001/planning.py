    # !!Note1: Common Mistakes! pick -> fold -> place (x), fold -> pick -> place (o) 
    # !!Note2: Do not assume or change the physical properties of the object.
    # 1. Fold object2 (transparent_2D_circle) since it's foldable.
    # 2. Pick and place object2 into the box.
    # 3. Bend object3 (black_1D_line) since it's bendable.
    # 4. Pick and place object3 into the box.
    # 5. Pick and place object1 (blue_3D_cylinder) into the box.
    # 6. Pick and place object0 (red_3D_cuboid) into the box, ensuring a compressible object is already in the box.

    # Non-plastic objects are placed without constraints, and the plastic object is placed after a compressible object is already in the box.
    # The actions ensure that the robot's hand is empty before and after folding and bending, and the plastic object is placed last.
