    # !!Note1: Common Mistakes! pick -> fold -> place (x), fold -> pick -> place (o) 
    # !!Note2: Do not assume or change the physical properties of the object.

    # Object3 is bendable, so it was bent before being picked and placed.
    # Object2 is foldable, so it was folded before being picked and placed.
    # Object1 is compressible, so it was picked, placed, and then pushed.
    # Object0 is rigid, so it was simply picked and placed without additional actions.
    # All actions respect the constraints and ensure the goal state is achieved.
