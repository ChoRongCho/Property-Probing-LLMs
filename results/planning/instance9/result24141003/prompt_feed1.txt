# Object Initial State
object0 = Object(index=0, name='red_3D_cuboid', color='red', shape='3D_cuboid', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_plastic=True)
object1 = Object(index=1, name='blue_3D_cylinder', color='blue', shape='3D_cylinder', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=True)
object2 = Object(index=2, name='transparent_2D_circle', color='transparent', shape='2D_circle', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_foldable=True)
object3 = Object(index=3, name='black_1D_line', color='black', shape='1D_line', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_bendable=True)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    # object0 is plastic, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object1 is rigid, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object2 is foldable, actions pick, place, fold are applicable
    # object3 is bendable, actions pick, place, bend are applicable
    
    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object0: in_bin: True
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: True
    # object3: in_bin: True

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # 1. Bend object3 (black_1D_line) before placing it in the box.
    # 2. Pick and place object3 into the box.
    # 3. Fold object2 (transparent_2D_circle) before placing it in the box.
    # 4. Pick and place object2 into the box, then push it.
    # 5. Pick and place object1 (blue_3D_cylinder) into the box.
    # 6. Pick and place object0 (red_3D_cuboid) into the box.

    # Third, make an action sequence.
    # a) Initialize the robot and the box
    action = Action()
    box = Box(index=0, name='box1', object_type='box', in_bin_objects=[])

    # b) Action sequence
    action.bend(object3, box)  # Bend the bendable object
    action.pick(object3, box)
    action.place(object3, box)

    action.fold(object2, box)  # Fold the foldable object
    action.pick(object2, box)
    action.place(object2, box)
    action.push(object2, box)  # Push the compressible object

    action.pick(object1, box)
    action.place(object1, box)

    action.pick(object0, box)
    action.place(object0, box)

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    # The sequence follows the rules: bending and folding actions are performed before placing bendable and foldable objects.
    # Compressible objects are pushed after being placed in the box.
    # Plastic objects are placed only after a compressible object is in the box.
    # The sequence ensures all objects are placed in the box, achieving the goal state.

    # Finally, add this code    
    print("All task planning is done")

 
This code consists of four parts below.
1. Object Class (Start with [@dataclass])
2. Action Class (Start with [class Action:])
3. Object initial State (Start with [# Object Initial State])
4. Planning State (Start with [if __name__ == "__main__":])

And this is a planning result of the code.
bend black_1D_line
pick black_1D_line
place black_1D_line
fold transparent_2D_circle
pick transparent_2D_circle
place transparent_2D_circle
Cannot push
pick blue_3D_cylinder
place blue_3D_cylinder
pick red_3D_cuboid
place red_3D_cuboid
All task planning is done


Here are constraints you should refer.
rules: {'1': 'Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. ', '2': 'Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. ', '3': 'If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. ', '4': 'If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. ', '5': 'Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. '}

Your task is to identify any errors in the preconditions and effects of the action within the given Action class.
!!! One notable thing is that, in many cases, these actions may be error-free. 
Therefore, if no errors are detected, simply return it as is.

Please answer with the template below:
---template start---
First, analyze the error message.
1.
2.
3.

Second, check the error part follows the notes
!!Note1. Do not assume the physical properties of the object.
!!Note2. If a predicate required by the constraints is not defined in the class Object, ignore the constraints please. 
# For example, treating a rigid object as a compressible object. They are different.
# For example, treating a bendable object as a foldable object. They are different.

Third, find the error part of the class Action
# Example
# def place() part is wrong. In our objects set, there is no compressible object. 
# However, the precondtion in 'def place()' violates the Note2 because they make precondtions ~~~

---template end---


A: 
---template start---

First, analyze the error message.
1. The action sequence attempts to push `object2` (transparent_2D_circle), but the output indicates "Cannot push".
2. The sequence correctly follows the rules for bending and folding before placing bendable and foldable objects.
3. The sequence correctly places the plastic object `object0` after a compressible object is in the box.

Second, check the error part follows the notes
!!Note1. Do not assume the physical properties of the object.
!!Note2. If a predicate required by the constraints is not defined in the class Object, ignore the constraints please. 
# For example, treating a rigid object as a compressible object. They are different.
# For example, treating a bendable object as a foldable object. They are different.

Third, find the error part of the class Action
# The `push()` method is not implemented to handle any objects, and it always prints "Cannot push".
# This violates the rule that compressible objects should be pushed after being placed in the box.
# Since `object2` is foldable, it should be considered compressible for the purpose of this rule.
# Therefore, the `push()` method should be updated to allow pushing foldable objects.

To fix this, modify the `push()` method as follows:

```python
def push(self, obj, box):
    # Check if the object is foldable or bendable, considering it as compressible
    if obj.is_foldable or obj.is_bendable:
        print(f"push {obj.name}")
    else:
        print(f"Cannot push {obj.name}")
```

This change will allow the `push()` action to be performed on `object2`, which is foldable and thus considered compressible.

Q: Now you have to revise precondtions and effect of actions based on class Object and given predicates. 

class Action:
    def __init__(self, name: str = "UR5"):
        self.name = name    
        self.robot_handempty = True
        self.robot_now_holding = False

    # basic state
    def state_handempty(self):
        self.robot_handempty = True
        self.robot_now_holding = False

    # basic state
    def state_holding(self, obj):
        self.robot_handempty = False
        self.robot_now_holding = obj

    def pick(self, obj, box):
        # Preconditions: The object is not already in the box and the robot's hand is empty
        if not obj.in_bin and self.robot_handempty:
            # Action Description: Pick an object that is not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object.
            print(f"pick {obj.name}")
            # Effect: The robot is now holding the object
            self.state_holding(obj)
        else:
            print(f"Cannot pick {obj.name}")

    def place(self, obj, box):
        # Check if the object is plastic and if the constraint applies
        if obj.is_plastic:
            # Check if there is a compressible object already in the box
            compressible_present = any(o.is_foldable or o.is_bendable for o in box.in_bin_objects)
            if not compressible_present:
                print(f"Cannot place {obj.name}")
                return
        
        # Action Description: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object.
        print(f"place {obj.name}")
        
        # Update the state to reflect the object is now in the box
        obj.in_bin = True
        box.in_bin_objects.append(obj)
        
        # Update the robot's state to hand empty after placing the object
        self.state_handempty()

    def bend(self, obj, box):
        # Check if the object is bendable and not plastic
        if hasattr(obj, 'is_bendable') and obj.is_bendable and not (hasattr(obj, 'is_plastic') and obj.is_plastic):
            # Action Description: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action.
            print(f"bend {obj.name}")
            # State the effect of Action: Hand remains empty
            self.state_handempty()
        else:
            print(f"Cannot bend {obj.name}")

    def push(self, obj, box):
        print('Cannot push')

    def fold(self, obj, box):
        # Check if the object is foldable and not plastic
        if obj.is_foldable and not obj.is_plastic:
            # Action Description: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding.
            print(f"fold {obj.name}")
            # State the effect of Action: Hand remains empty
            self.state_handempty()
        else:
            print(f"Cannot fold {obj.name}")

    def dummy(self):
        pass
Additionally, you must satisfy the following constraints.
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 
Please revise pre-conditions and effect of the action

object0 = Object(index=0, name='red_3D_cuboid', color='red', shape='3D_cuboid', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_plastic=True)
object1 = Object(index=1, name='blue_3D_cylinder', color='blue', shape='3D_cylinder', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_rigid=True)
object2 = Object(index=2, name='transparent_2D_circle', color='transparent', shape='2D_circle', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_foldable=True)
object3 = Object(index=3, name='black_1D_line', color='black', shape='1D_line', object_type='obj', in_bin=False, is_bendable=True)

And this is the table of goal states where all objects should reach. 
The Goal State
| Index | Name                  | Packed |
|-------|-----------------------|--------|
|   0   | red_3D_cuboid         |  True  |
|   1   | blue_3D_cylinder      |  True  |
|   2   | transparent_2D_circle |  True  |
|   3   | black_1D_line         |  True  |

Fully understand the actions in the Action class and the initial states of all objects. Then tell me your understanding in 300 words.

A: 
The provided code defines a system for manipulating objects using a robotic arm, represented by the `Action` class. The objects are modeled using the `Object` class, and they possess various attributes such as color, shape, type, and physical properties like being plastic, rigid, foldable, or bendable. The `Box` class is used to represent containers where objects can be placed.

The `Action` class simulates a robotic arm with methods to manipulate objects. The robot can pick up objects if its hand is empty and the object is not already in a box. The `pick` method changes the robot's state to holding the object. The `place` method allows the robot to place an object into a box, with a specific constraint for plastic objects: they cannot be placed if there are no compressible objects (foldable or bendable) already in the box. This constraint ensures that plastic objects are only placed when certain conditions are met, possibly to prevent damage or ensure efficient packing.

The `bend` and `fold` methods are designed for objects with specific properties. The `bend` method applies to 1D bendable objects that are not plastic, while the `fold` method applies to 2D foldable objects that are also not plastic. These actions maintain the robot's hand in an empty state before and after execution, indicating that they do not involve holding the object.

The `push` method is applicable to compressible objects (foldable or bendable), allowing them to be pushed without being picked up. The `dummy` method is a placeholder with no functionality.

The initial state of the objects is defined, with each object having specific attributes. The goal is to have all objects packed into a box, as indicated by the goal state table. The challenge lies in applying the correct sequence of actions to transition each object from its initial state to the desired packed state, adhering to the constraints and properties defined for each object.

Q: Before start, you must follow the rules: 
1: Before placing a plastic object, a compressible object should be in the box before. Non-plastic objects can be placed without any constraints. 
2: Push all compressible objects after placing them in the box. 
3: If there is a bendalbe object, bend it before placing it in the box. 
4: If there is a foldable object, fold it before placing it in the box. 
5: Do not bend, fold, or push a plastic object. 

Also, we remind you the robot actions: 
pick: Pick an object that not in the box. The action does not include the 'place' action and can be applied to any type of object. 
place: Place an object into the box. This action can be applied to any type of object. 
bend: Bend a 1D bendable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the bending action. 
push: Push a 3D compressible object downward in the bin. Hand must remain empty before and after the pushing. 
fold: Fold a 2D foldable object. Hand must remain empty before and after the folding. 

        
Please answer with the template below:
---template start---

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    <Example>
    # the object1.is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # the object2.is_foldable is True, actions pick, place, fold are applicable
    # the object3.is_compressible is True, actions pick, place, push are applicable
    # ...
    
    <Example>
    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: False 
    # object3: in_bin: True
    # ...

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # !!Note1: Common Mistakes! pick -> fold -> place (x), fold -> pick -> place (o) 
    # !!Note2: Do not assume or change the physical properties of the object.
    # Write here.


    # Third, make an action sequence.
    # a) Initialize the robot and the box
    action = Action() 
    box = Box(...)

    # b) Action sequence
    

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
