    object0.is_compressible = True  # Example attribute
    object1.is_bendable = True      # Example attribute
    object2.is_foldable = True      # Example attribute

    # the object1.is_bendable is True, actions pick, place, bend are applicable
    # the object2.is_foldable is True, actions pick, place, fold are applicable

    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object0: in_bin: True
    # object1: in_bin: True 
    # object2: in_bin: True

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # !!Note1: Common Mistakes! pick -> fold -> place (x), fold -> pick -> place (o) 
    # !!Note2: Do not assume or change the physical properties of the object.
    # Write here.
    # 1. Bend object1 (bendable), then pick and place it.
    # 2. Fold object2 (foldable), then pick and place it.
    # 3. Pick object0 (compressible) and place it, then push it.

    # Third, make an action sequence.
    # a) Initialize the robot and the box
    action = Action() 
    box = Box(index=0, name='box1', object_type='box', in_bin_objects=[])

    # Pick and place object1
    action.pick(object1, box)

    # Push object0

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    # The sequence follows the rules: bend the bendable object before placing, fold the foldable object before placing,
    # and push the compressible object after placing. The actions ensure that all objects are packed according to their properties.

    # Finally, add this code
