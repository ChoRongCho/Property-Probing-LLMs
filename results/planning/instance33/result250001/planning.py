    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    # object0: is_compressible is False, is_bendable is False, is_foldable is False, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object1: is_compressible is False, is_bendable is False, is_foldable is False, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object2: is_compressible is False, is_bendable is False, is_foldable is False, actions pick, place are applicable

    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object0: in_bin: True
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: True

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # Since there are no plastic, compressible, bendable, or foldable objects, we can directly pick and place them.
    # The order of packing does not matter as there are no constraints to consider.

    # Third, make an action sequence.
    # a) Initialize the robot and the box
    action = Action()

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    # All objects are non-plastic, non-compressible, non-bendable, and non-foldable.
    # Therefore, they can be picked and placed directly without any additional actions.
    # The robot's hand is empty before and after each pick and place action, satisfying the constraints.

    # Finally, add this code
