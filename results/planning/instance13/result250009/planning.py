    # First, from initial state, recall the physical properties of objects and available actions:
    # object0: is_rigid is True, actions pick, place are applicable
    # object1: is_foldable is True, actions pick, place, fold are applicable
    # object2: is_foldable is True, actions pick, place, fold are applicable
    # object3: is_compressible is True, actions pick, place, push are applicable
    # object4: is_compressible is True, actions pick, place, push are applicable

    # Rewrite the goal states of all objects given in the table in the following format.
    # object0: in_bin: True
    # object1: in_bin: True
    # object2: in_bin: True
    # object3: in_bin: True
    # object4: in_bin: True

    # Second, write a bin_packing order based on the given rules and the goal states of the objects.
    # 1. Pick object3 (compressible), place it, then push it.
    # 2. Pick object4 (compressible), place it, then push it.
    # 3. Pick object1 (foldable), fold it, then place it.
    # 4. Pick object2 (foldable), fold it, then place it.
    # 5. Pick object0 (rigid), place it.

    # Third, make an action sequence.
    # a) Initialize the robot and the box
    action = Action()
    box = Box(index=0, name='bin', object_type='box', in_bin_objects=[])

    # b) Action sequence
    action.pick(object3, box)
    action.place(object3, box)
    action.push(object3, box)

    action.pick(object4, box)
    action.place(object4, box)
    action.push(object4, box)

    action.fold(object1, box)
    action.pick(object1, box)
    action.place(object1, box)

    action.fold(object2, box)
    action.pick(object2, box)
    action.place(object2, box)

    action.pick(object0, box)
    action.place(object0, box)

    # Fourth, after making all actions, provide your reasoning based on the given rules.
    # The sequence follows the rules: compressible objects are placed and pushed first, ensuring that any subsequent plastic objects can be placed without constraint. Foldable objects are folded before being picked and placed. The rigid object is placed last as it has no constraints. This ensures all objects are packed according to their properties and the given rules.

    # Finally, add this code    
    print("All task planning is done")
