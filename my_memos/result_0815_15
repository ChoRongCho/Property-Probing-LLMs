Now that you've obtained the spatial information of the objects, you need to describe shape, color, and dimension of each object. \\
And for clarity, I will provide the original images. Please identify the shape, dimension, and color of each object based on these images according to the definitions in "[Definitions of dimensions and shapes]" below. \\
Your answer must follow the naming convention which is "color_dimension_shape" (e.g., red_3D_cuboid or black_2D_ring). \\
Ensure that there is no contradiction between the shape and dimension. For example, "1D" and "loop" or "3D" and "circle" are not compatible according to their definitions in "[Definitions of dimensions and shapes]". \\

[Definitions of dimensions and shapes] \\
Dimension \\
1D: One-dimensional object, such as thin and sharp thing \\
2D: Two-dimensional object, without height \\
3D: Three-dimensional object \\
 \\
 \\
Shape \\
1D \\
Line: A one-dimensional object characterized by a straight path connecting two endpoints, having a definite length but no width. If an object is with an empty center, it should not be a line. \\
 \\
2D \\
Circle: A two-dimensional round object with every point on its edge equidistant from its center \\
Rectangle: A two-dimensional polygonal object with opposite sides equal and four right angles \\
Triangle: A two-dimensional polygonal object with three sides and three angles \\
Polygon: A two-dimensional object with multiple straight sides (e.g., a pentagon is with 5 sides, a hexagon is with 6 sides) \\
Loop: A two-dimensional object with a closed curve characterized by an empty center, forming a continuous loop \\
 \\
3D \\
Sphere: A round three-dimensional object where every point on its surface is equidistant from its center \\
Cube: A three-dimensional object with six equal square faces \\
Cuboid: A three-dimensional object with six rectangular faces \\
Pyramid: A three-dimensional object with a polygonal base and triangular faces that converge to a single point \\
Cylinder: A three-dimensional object with two parallel circular bases connected by a curved surface \\
Cone: A three-dimensional object with a circular base that tapers to a single point \\
Polyhedron: A three-dimensional object with flat polygonal faces, straight edges, and vertices, \\
